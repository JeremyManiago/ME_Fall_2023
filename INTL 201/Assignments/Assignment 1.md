Jeremy Maniago

INTL 201

Professor Dr. Evans Dennis

_**Assignment 1**_

Hello, my name is Jeremy Maniago. I'm currently a senior in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Physics. I was born in the Philippines and moved to NYC in 2005. I like solving puzzles, listening to music, reading books, philosophy, engineering, and physics. I am taking INTL 20100 because it had topics that I was interested in adding to my knowledge bank. Another reason is because it fulfills my engineering liberal arts requirements, and fits in my packed schedule (since it is asynchronous). I hope to learn about international relations, cultures, and the interactions that different places and people in the world make with each other. I hope to be able to determine global issues and how to find the root cause of international issues.
