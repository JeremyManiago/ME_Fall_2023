      For the final exam, you are being asked to synthesize and apply the concepts and approaches learned in the Political Dimensions of Globalization and Applications section of the class to analyze a case of environmental activism.

In Lechner, Frank J. and Boli, John.  The Globalization Reader. 5th ed. (Wiley,  2014) (Chapter 65, pp.510-519).
