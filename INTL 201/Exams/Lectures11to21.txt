so this marks the beginning of a new section of the class and we will learn about the political dimensions of global interconnectedness you're going to learn about the meaning of the nation the historical context in which nation states have developed the concept of national sovereignty the international system in which states interact with each other the concept of nationalism and the idea of citizenship you will also be learning about the challenges to the nation-state and National sovereignty to advise some globalization the nation state is no longer considered an independent and supremely Powerful actor for a variety of reasons the global movement of non-citizen migrants that circulate for economic political and safety reasons presents One Challenge to this idea another challenge is a growth of global economic networks and the increase in Regional and Global governance organizations they've developed to solve transnational Collective action problems a third challenge to the idea of sovereignty and the supreme authority of the nation state his idea of ultimate State sovereignty and the international system in which nation states are the only kind of actor are being challenged by the role and importance of international non-governmental organizations and other kinds of voluntary organizations to establish International standards these have profoundly influence how nation states engage with one another and exercise power even within their own borders you will be exploring each of these issues in order to gain a global perspective about the political dimensions of globalization in the current state of the world impressive project will be guest lecturing you about nationalism what it is and how it led to the creation of nation states and this will lay the foundation to help you understand the opposite of what the nation is which is globalization and internationalism the remainder of the lecture is given by my colleague Eva po-drug if we just go very basically to the Oxford English dictionary dictionary definition of Nations and nationalism um the Oxford English Dictionary defines a nation as a large aggregate of individuals and communities United by factors such as but not limited to uh and not necessarily including common dissent common language common culture or values common history or common occupation of the same physical territory so as to form a distinct people uh it is also such a people forming an independent Sovereign political state nationalism is the idea that such Nations should be self-governing that each Nation should form its own political States nationalism is also the Devotion to the interests of One's Own nation and its members especially to the exclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations and this is like it's it's I think that there's been a move towards internationalism and international values but there's something inescapable about nationalism in that we all have some sort of national identity that may not be our it may not be you know what's listed on our birth certificate it may not be our passport but it's often where we grew up or whom we associate with and uh like a funny story from my own per or not so funny story from my own personal experience um I was somebody who grew up the child of immigrants in New York City and so I always I never had a very strong sense of myself as American as opposed to something else I kind of thought of myself as somebody living in a Cosmopolis in a world city with all different uh immigrants ethnicities like and all different nations coming together and also tourists like people staying for a short time and I felt very like belonging to kind of the world and also the fact that I was raised Catholic and that is a very International religion uh you're not supposed to care where someone comes from but I was in college I was a senior in college when 9 11 happened and all of a sudden everything changed for me my boyfriend called me on the phone and he said I'm I'm going to join the Army today I'm going to join up and sign for Afghanistan like they hit us we're hitting them what are you gonna do for the country and I was like oh my God like I need to do something and I completely did a 180 to all my previous beliefs and I had like some immune physical problems so I figured I would not be very good in the Army but I went and the NSA was recruit recruiting on campus and I signed up with them and I took a few tests and I was totally ready this is priest Snowden this is pre-aboo gray this is pre-all the awful things that happened right this is just like the week after 9 11. and you know a month later I was ready to go to Virginia for my like in-person interview and I had to ask my mom for train fare and my mom was like you're doing what are you kidding me do you know what the American government has done overseas do you know all the coops they've planned in Central America in Chile like do you know what they do she's like this is fake like the people Afghanistan did not do anything to you a few crazy murdering zealots did stuff to you she's like no no daughter of mine like no no you cannot be my daughter if you do this and so I didn't go in the interview and I didn't do it and then later when things got worse and worse and there were drone strikes that killed civilians in Iraq and everything I was really grateful to her for stopping me but that sort of I think a good story of how even if you think you don't have a national identity somewhere underneath there is one lurking um so it's also interesting to note that there are two kinds of nationalism although we often lump them together there's two kinds of nationalism corresponding to two kinds of citizenship there's ethnic nationalism and there's Civic nationalism ethnic nationalism is associated with Nations that have inherited citizenship that is states where you are a citizen if and only if one or both of your parents are citizens uh in this case belonging to a nation is based on what is legally termed use sanguinis Latin for the right of the blood and a lot of countries in Europe actually have this as your basis of citizenship so for instance if I'm born in uh Croatia to non-croatian parents if like my parents are Americans who decide hey Croatia's nice beaches let's move there and I'm born there that doesn't mean anything I don't I don't have automatic citizenship and actually most European countries had this as the basis of their citizenship for most of the time uh Germany was a very uh very prominent example of this until 2000 uh Germany was one of the largest states in the world that had only used sanguinis as the basis for citizenship and that ended up being very controversial in Germany because Germany had a lot of immigrants um from turkey and from the Balkans who you know had families who established families and raised their children so that their children did not speak Turkish or Croatian or Serbian but spoke German felt German were raised in Germany but didn't have German citizenship and this was finally changed in 2000 where they changed it to like okay if one of your parents has been a legal resident for three years and you have spent at least eight years of your childhood in Germany will be okay but before that even though we think of Germany as a post-war Germany is a very liberal place it was actually very exclusionary uh when it came to citizenship uh the second kind of nationalism is Civic nationalism and that is associated with Nations that have Birthright citizenships and Birthright citizenship is citizen Citizenship where you are a citizen of a given Nation if you happen to be born within the territory of that Nation regardless of whether your parents happen to be just citizens and uh this is the definition of citizenship that we're used to in the United States uh in this case it's the basis of citizenship is uh based on what is legally termed use Solly which in Latin means the right of the soil and it's funny because we tend to assume that most countries are like this but actually it's it's distinctively something in it's distinctly pure use solely citizenship where it doesn't matter if either of your parents are um citizens or even legal residents is actually pretty much confined to North and South South America and later I'll tell you why and there's a second subset of of Civic nationalism which is more rare and that's associated with earned citizenship now that citizenship won through voluntarily assimilating to the values of your chosen nation that you've immigrated to and uh also through service to that Nation uh this is actually a very old Concept in ancient Rome non-citizens could win citizenship by volunteering to serve a full 20-year term in the Army and since Rome was always at war that was a pretty risky that was a pretty daring thing to do but if you made it 20 years through your campaigns you received uh what was called the Roman military diploma and you've got full Roman citizenship no matter what your background and a pension and this is also the case in the United States today uh an illegal immigrant can become a citizen by volunteering to serve in the military for combat Duty during wartime and I actually happen to know two people who joined up to the military to go to Iraq and Afghanistan respectively just in order to gain U.S citizenship which was very sobering for me because here is something that I was taking for granted um just because I had always you know I was born here and I'd always had it and they were putting their lives on the line in order to get it um so let's talk about perceptions of nationalism nationalism has I'm sure when you hear the word you probably don't have positive associations with it um thinking for yourself and intolerance towards others and also War right and nationalism has a particularly bad and deserved reputation because it was the primary cause of the bloodiest and most horrific war in all of human history which was World War II when conservative estimates are that somewhere between 70 and 85 million people were killed um the whole reason we have international institutions is they were all pretty much set up in the 40s and 50s to try to stop a World War III because everyone was so exhausted by their lived exp that whole generation of people who lived through World War II were so traumatized and exhausted by their experience that the war itself completely discredited nationalism for them and they want to deliberately um to move to internationalism this was particularly true of the kind of two core countries that had around which World War one and two had been oriented France and Germany which had hated each other for centuries but were so intent on forgetting that past that they created um a common a common commission so that they would have free so that their major Industrial Products that could be used for war which is coal and steel that they would kind of open each other's markets to that and kind of produce those in tandem not produce them separately and the European coal and steel commission originally between France and Germany later grew to become the European Union also the United Nations was established first in San Francisco then it moved to New York uh as a place to try to get Nations to talk things out rather than just go to war with each other um so nationalism deservedly has a bad rap but we can't look at it in a balanced way unless we also note that it has provided the foundation for two um very positive historical developments that we actually mostly take for granted now one is democracy ruled by the majority and two is the welfare state where the state cares about individuals well-beings um now democracy I'm I should Define terms democracy I understand is the twin principles that all citizens have equal rights and are subject to the same laws one and two that governments are legitimized by the decisions of the majority of citizens the welfare state I understand as any state that cares for its citizens well-being such as a state that provides social security for elderly people or even something as basic as a free primary education for children or clean water for its citizens and this is an important Point uh Republicans well not all Republicans some conservative Republicans use the welfare state the phrase the welfare state as something negative uh something that we should try to avoid but that's a misnomer because America already is a welfare state because actually every single modern State that's functioning that isn't like Somalia which is a completely non-functioning so-called failed state every single functioning modern state that we know of today is by definition a welfare state because everything every place provides uh roads clean water free primary education the only difference is to what degree is it a welfare state is it a welfare state like America which provides infrastructure education and Social Security and now Health Care um but not all the way or is it a welfare state like a European welfare state which provides everything America provides plus um really extensive unemployment insurance uh unit free University education and full health care and how can I say where am I getting this idea that nationalism is a foundation for democracy and the welfare state well let's one kind of one way of approaching this is just to look at the etymology of um the words nation and nationalism to find out the word Nation comes from the Latin not you the past participle of the Latin Master which means to be born and Nation literally means all those who have been born on the surface this sounds like a silly unnecessary word right like what is the special what is the purpose of having a special word just to mean all those who have been born but it's significant because for the majority of for like the most of recorded history anyone who was born was immediately identified classified and stratified first of all according to their family group blood relations and second of all according to their social class and their family's position in very hierarchical societies so just by having the word Nation uh and including all of those who are born we the the having that very word transcends distinctions between families and socioeconomic status and classes in order to include everyone who was born in a given Society thus we can see right away here that there is an implied kind of interpersonal social equality and communitarianism in the very word Nation itself um in the words of uh the most famous historian on this most famous scholar of nationalism Benedict Anderson uh he said quote regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail the nation is always conceived of as a deep horizontal comradeship ultimately it is this fraternity that made it possible for the past two centuries for so many people millions of people to willingly die for their Nation this is like a very interesting Point um this social equality because say a European Knight um or a Arab or Turkish or Egyptian night fighting in the Middle Ages or at Chinese Knight or Samurai fighting in the Middle Ages wasn't that would never be fighting for their Nation they wouldn't have that concept they would be fighting for their personal honor because they made a pledge to their feudal Lord for loyalty and then their feudal Lord got enough beef with someone and they had it was their honor was on the line they had to support like their guy they fought for honor and they fought for religion but sometimes when they had no other options uh they fought for money they were mercenaries uh certain certain uh it's funny certain regions of Europe and the Middle East that were very mountainous and had very poor agriculture had this tradition of they they always had too many kids like we all kind of had before contraception everyone kind of had kids at the same rate but you didn't have equally productive agriculture so typically mountainous regions would kind of export men to serve as mercenaries because they wouldn't have land to farm so anyway people before nationalism people would fight to defend their Village or family for local reasons they would defy fight for Honor because they had pledged their loyalty to their lord um they would fight for religion and they would fight for money but they certainly wouldn't fight for the idea that like I in New York would find the idea that like someone in Louisiana would choose to fight because a bunch of buildings in New York have been attacked would have been absolutely ludicrous like nobody fought for their nation and yet the idea of nationalism it was possible to mobilize these huge armies of millions of people in World War one and two so let's look at the history of national identity how it came to be the history of nationalism and um how it came to be that you had this ideology that so many people believed in there's kind of a debate among Scholars and historians over when we should really focus the study of nationalism um there's a smaller group called The perennialists or the organocists that think that there's there's always really been a sense of defined people um of defined distinctions between people and they focus on the nation part of nationalism and then there's a larger group that I think has more Scholars and more evidence on its side called the constructivists that Focus kind of on the ism in nationalism and that say no no nationalism was only explicitly elaborated in the 18th century with a series of revolutions first the American Revolution then the French Revolution and then the Revolutions in South America started in Colombia by Simon Bolivar so they focus on the ism like but the organic ones focus on the nation and the fact that from the beginning of recorded history it has always been recognized that there are groups of people who have a common identity Beyond kinship with identity Beyond family identity that sets them apart from other people uh one of the oldest uses of this word is in the Hebrew Bible also known as the Old Testament already at the very beginning in Genesis 12 2 when the Lord promises Abraham and I will make of thee a great nation or in Deuteronomy the Lord repeatedly promises the Israelites I will set thee above other Nate I will set thee as a nation above other nations but it was only in the so that's that's the people who that's kind of the scholars that like to focus on the Antiquity of nationalism they often cite the ancient Israelites the Jews the Old Testaments that that's one of their key uh arguments but it was only in the 18th century that many people started thinking that Nations should be coterminus with states that is that every nation should form its own political unit uh for the vast majority of History Most states were not nation states but dynastic States and just you know a dynasty or Dynasty I never know how I've heard it pronounce both ways um is Rule passed down by hereditary by heredity ruled by members of a single family and um before World War One most people in most of the globe was covered by dynastic Empires or monarchies that were not a lie that were kind of not coterminous in any way with nationalities for instance um I'll give you an instance of two of the longest lasting empires in history the Habsburg monarchy uh later renamed the austro-hungarian Empire it lasted from 1292 until the end of world war which destroyed it in 1918 it had 10 different recognized component Nations by the time it ended and it also had 10 different recognized national languages which made their bureaucracy extremely complicated and top-heavy so that a lot of the society was employed in bureaucracy just to translate all these things from one language to another another example is the Ottoman Empire which ruled so so many you know Arabs and Arabs who felt different like Arabs from Saudi Arabia feel different than Arabs from Egypt feel different than Arabs from Tunisia and Turks and Armenians and azerbaijanis it ruled all these people and Christian Slavic peoples but if you like went into a time machine to the Ottoman Empire to a turkish-speaking town and said hey you're Turkish they'd be like what the hell are you talking about like they wouldn't understand that label um they would identify themselves either by their social class or by their like I'm a carpenter or I'm a Tradesman or they would or I'm landowner or they'd identify themselves by their religion um so the question is what are the historical conditions that made nationalism possible both as a way for people to identify themselves and as a political doctrine of self-determinations so again let's let's I'm going to go to Benedict Anderson's definition of Nations and go through kind of like what are the six points that you need Benedict Anderson defined Nations as communities or societies whose members were characterized by one a sense of themselves as distinct from their neighbors two a shared national language three a shared sense of common values and Norms sometimes not necessarily a shared religion but certainly a shared sense of morality for a shared sense of National Origins history and tradition five an ability to imagine co-nationals whom they would never see or meet an ability to imagine that you have something in common with someone from Louisiana even if you've never been to Louisiana and will never go to Louisiana and finally six a sense of popular National sovereignty a sense that the ruling government is somehow supposed to represent or at least reflect the will of identity the interests of Ordinary People as opposed to what as opposed to a government that is divinely ordained and Beyond questioning that's just there because the mountains are there that's there and you can't it's not there to reflect you it's not there to serve you um it just is a a trial trial of life that you have to bear a burden you have to bear um so these if we go through these six points and then we go through what are the characteristics of pre-modern societies of societies before the 18th century that made it impossible for this Advanced National Consciousness to develop well first of all um the vast majority of people in pre-modern society whether in East Asia whether the Middle East whether in South America whether in Europe uh they were these communities were hyper hyper local and culturally homogeneous uh so that most people never even met people that were different that they than they were and against whose difference they could Define themselves because you always kind of Define yourself against a difference if you've you know if you've never met anybody with long hair you'll assume that everybody has short hair like kind of that it's it's that stupid but it's it's like a truism um so in pre-modern societies the vast majority of the population was engaged in full-time agriculture and travel was which does not really leave time to like move around much and uh travel was also difficult and dangerous uh there was kind of no Public Safety so people rarely traveled farther than their Village and The Villages surrounding their Village um thus the vast majority of people never met someone who worshiped in a different way than they did or who spoke a completely incomprehensible language so for most people there was no sense of religion or language being identity defining because there was no def difference against which to Define such an identity I repeat this so much because it's when I first learned it it was very mind-blowing to me uh maybe because I grew up in New York and everybody was from somewhere else um but for instance in many European dialects uh before European languages were standardized into national languages in many European dialects the word Christian was used interchangeably with man person or human so they would say we are Christians not animals and they didn't mean Muslims or animals they just didn't even have a word for Muslims like if that makes sense um so there were hyperlocal and culturally homogeneous that kind of covers why they didn't develop one to three uh of the national sense of not distinctive nation's sense of distinctive value sense of distinctive language and for uh covering points four and five they were illiterate so they couldn't communicate across distances or imagine communicating across distances and it is many people have argued including Benedict Anderson but also a lot of social psychologists that one of the things that allows us to imagine commonalities with people who are very far away from us is the potential we have of communicating with them now it's like I happen not to write letters to strangers in Washington state but I could like and they would get there and they would read them so they're sort of um an imagined possibility of communication that creates identity that is vastly vastly um greater in societies with writing in literate societies than in pre-literate societies finally uh as regards to political sovereignty before the before the 18th century before the enlightenment of the French Revolution uh people didn't have any conception that their rulers should represent their will or identity rather they believe that rulers are chosen by God or the Gods or Heaven they believe that rulers are chosen by God according to whomever God happens to favor on the battlefield so it was a kind of divinely sanctioned might makes right it wasn't just might makes right and it wasn't just Divine tension it was divinely sanctioned might makes right um now the only exceptions you had to this were the very few large cities that were engaged in long-distance trade across different cultures and religions such as Venice such as Constantinople that we talked a few years ago such as Cairo their people had more of a sense of okay I'm a Muslim that's a Christian that's a Jew um and Borderlands between kingdoms with different religions that were always switching hands so in Europe the most people people's the most acute sense of national identity could be found in the Western border in the southwestern border between Europe and Islam which is Spain Spain and North Africa um and the eastern border between Christianity and Islam which was the Balkans so there people would have like some sense of of difference but again that difference would be religious and not ethnic uh basically big cities along but there were very few big cities uh big cities that were part of long distance trade um that might cross uh religious bound or or language boundaries uh most cities were really just engaged in regional trade so not say like London was not such a city London didn't really have minorities um but say uh Venice was such a city because there were both Christians and Turks there Rome is sort of this weird kind of I would say exception to most pre-modern societies uh I would say both Rome and China are exceptions and that people in Rome it was like Rome within itself was globalized in I mean globalize is the wrong word Rome within itself did have a sense of citizenship that went beyond the local town but that was only because it was such an exceptional situation with so much trade so much agricultural Surplus so much military activity all these things that tie countries together and the way the Romans did it which was very interesting is that the Romans had um you could say they were like the first Multicultural Empire uh they had a syncretistic um attitude towards nationality so that they didn't insist that you feel just Roman like today if you're a citizen of France or Spain you can't have like a bunch of other citizenships you're just a citizen of one country but in ancient Rome um you were who you know whatever town or region whatever ethnic identity you had it could be Greek it could be Jewish but if you had Roman citizenship that gave you an additional status and like additional privileges like you could plead your case um to go to a higher court if a lower court decided against you only if you were a Roman citizen so uh Roman the Roman Empire was like the first time in history that you had these hyphenated identities where you had people who identified both with like their hyper local situation and with being Roman and if you go into the capitalized Museum in Rome today you'll see a lot of um ancient headstones where one side of the headstone is inscribed in whatever mother language the person had who was non who was not ethnically Latin um who you know didn't grow up speaking Latin all these crazy variety of ancient languages Phoenician ancient Arabic Aramaic and then on the flip side you would have the same inscription in Latin because these people really that did have two identities but that was sort of um I would say exceptional to Rome if that makes sense so how did nationalism come about the first the first thing that had to happen was the spread of literacy and the replacement of Latin with the vernacular spoken languages of Europe and we're going to focus on Europe because that's where nationalism started the vast majority of the population in Europe was literate was illiterate the only people who were literate was that were the nobility and some merchants and they were all literate not in their spoken languages usually but in Latin because the medieval states of Europe inherited their law codes from the Roman Empire after the Roman Empire broke up and they inherited their religious rights from the church as it had been formed under from the Christian from the Catholic Church as it had been formed under the Roman Empire they inherited the Latin translation of the Bible from Heap from Hebrew Old Testament and Greek New Testament into the Latin Vulgate uh translated into Latin by Saint Jerome so both their religious and their administrative languages were was one language it was Latin but nobody spoke it anymore so you had a class that was literate but it was literate in an international language not in a spoken language and um the same thing actually prevailed in uh the Middle East with um all the caliph like the the Arabic of the Quran and of the early caliphs became the Standard Arabic of religion of learning of education and of administration and later like that was what is known as classical Arabic and later Arabic diverged I mean it diverged less than say French diverts from Latin but in many cases it was still not intelligible fully to people who are not literate so um basically in when Rome first became Christian and when the Middle East first became Muslim people could Ordinary non-literate People could understand the prayers but over time as the spoken languages changed but the written languages remained the same and they had to remain the same because they were in both Islam and Christianity languages were seen as the vessel of the Sacred because the Bible was in Latin and uh the Quran was in classical Arabic and it was considered sacrilegious to try to translate or update them so you had this kind of Divergence of spoken language and written language that both that in the Opera classes created a sense of transnational Unity or like a nobleman from Spain to talk to like a nobleman from Hungary um or a nobleman from Morocco could talk to like a nobleman from Egypt but the local population didn't understand like what was going on most of the time and this finally uh slowly became slowly slowly slowly in Europe as local Administration grew as kind of governments developed and took over more functions they needed more people to work in government than were educated in Latin and they started taking people you sort of sort of had a slow development in every single country of local language being used for administration and for literature rather than Latin and it happened at different speeds in different places like one of the earliest places that happened was England um where they switched from uh old from old from Latin being the language of administration to old uh Norman being the language of administration to like finally like some early English being the language Administration it happened very late in other places um in France it didn't happen until the 1500s Latin was the language of administration even though everybody spoke French at home in Eastern Europe Latin in Austria-Hungary on the Latin was a language Administration until the early 19th century so first you have the development of vernacular languages and then you have the development of literacy through printing because part of the reason that people didn't read was that there were so few books to read or to teach themselves to read Because books were had to be hand copied all books were essentially illuminated manuscripts they were copied copied by monks hand copied and they were very very very few of them and only the nobility or the high clergy could even afford to buy or keep a book but um the Europeans came in trading with China came to the idea of the Chinese had invented block printing that they used for like um printing presses where you carved Chinese characters into wood and then pressed it onto paper and the Europeans took the Chinese inventions of block Printing and paper previously they had used Vellum which was made of um animal skins and which is much harder more expensive to produce than paper they took block Printing and paper and they added the idea of movable type right because unlike Chinese characters which could be like whole words you'd have letters and you can combine you only need 27 blocks to express any word in a given European language so the event with the help of having Alpha but the invented movable type and a mechanized press based on Old Olive presses and you suddenly had printed books the first printed book we think was 1439 in Germany and once you started having printed books they were they became cheaper and cheaper and cheaper produce more and more people printed them and more and more people bought them and it was kind of like a very Prestige commodity that then got democratized and that way it was like sugar if you remember sugar from a few weeks ago where initially only the richest people had access to Sugar but then as there was a more as there was more Supply there was more demand it was like one of those weird situations where instead of demand creating Supply Supply creates demand starts nationalism is the Protestant Reformation the Lutheran Reformation Martin Luther when he tacks on his uh Theses on the church doors at Wittenberg in 1517. one of his one of his losers key ideas is that people should be able to understand the church service that they're attending before that he he was sort of he kept seeing the situation where people went to church in this very ritualistic way where they went and they prayed and they stood and they bowed and they listened to um the priest conducting the service but especially in okay maybe in Italy Italian and Latin are close enough that you can kind of understand what's going on but like in Germany German and Latin are not related people did not understand they were just they're very ritualistically they were not actually hearing or understanding the text s and Luther said screw all of this ritual the point of religion the point of Christianity is following the Bible and how can we be how can worshipers how can uh Christians be expected to understand Christianity if they don't understand the Bible how can they be expected to understand the Bible if they don't understand the language of the Bible so he did this very revolutionary thing which is that that had previously been illegal and he was able to do it because he got a sympathetic local Prince Germany at that point was divided into a lot of little principalities that each had its own ruler and its own set of laws and Luther kind of went to this one Prince that was in intrigued by his ideas and got his political protection and Luther translated the New Testament into German into vernacular spoken German in 1522 and this was blew everybody's mind the idea that you could translate the Bible away from its holy language Latin and into a language spoken by Ordinary People in 1522 he translated the New Testament to German suddenly everybody in Germany who has any money wants to buy a cop like any merch obviously Farmers couldn't but any Merchant wants to buy uh a copy of the New Testament in German 1534 he translates you know the old testament which is much longer gets a complete Bible out there and the German of Luther's Bible becomes the basis of Modern Standard German and it inspires religious reformers all over Europe to break the law and start translating the Bible into vernacular languages and so Bible printing basically the history of printing in Europe is first you're printing a bunch of Latin Bibles and Latin devotional works then you're printing vernacular Bibles and then people start having fun with it and printing vernacular secular works like the first printed novels for instance Cervantes Don Quixote in the late 1500s but it's this explosion of literacy initiated by both the development of printing and the Protestant Reformation and the funny thing is how scared the ruling classes of Europe were when this first happened uh you know we think of France as this very Advanced and Progressive Place well uh the king of France Francois the first when they brought a print a printing press into France and people started printing stuff in in French he freaked out because he didn't want people to have access to information he didn't want people to read There was supposed to be this stable hierarchical ruling class that could read and write and then everybody else that was just supposed to shut up and work and like produce agricultural surpluses for the rulers to live off of and he actually prohibited Printing and on pain of hanging if you printed something you'd be killed but eventually he realized because printing was allowed in Venice and it printing was allowed in German states that printing you could tax books and get an income so he switched he like made a 180 on his position and was like okay okay you can have printing but uh yeah it was this printing that created a literature and once you had a literature that standardized vernacular language and that allowed readers and this is like very weird and kind of meta but if you think about it it'll make more sense it allowed readers to imagine a sense of community with other readers like you had the first newspapers for instance and they were like one she they weren't called newspapers they were called like broadleafs or the pamphlets or be like these one-sheet things that would have like what has happened in the past year and like what you know a lot of them would be filled with kind of tabloid kind of stories to get people to buy them like there were a lot of stories about oh a miraculous uh birth of a two-headed baby is it the sign of the end times it was kind of like the National Enquirer to get people's attention but people would buy these and they would know that because this newspaper was distributed across you know everybody who could speak French could buy one they could picture somebody that they had never met reading the same thing at the same time and this introduced a sense of time events of like events happening in time shared with people that you did not see face to face whereas previously uh any any communal communal events were limited to a sense of communally shared experience was limited to okay we're all in an Amphitheater watching uh Gladiators in Ancient Rome or we're all in church listening to this particular sermon in medieval Christianity but now you had okay even if I'm at home in the privacy of my own home and I don't see anyone I'm reading this and I know that everyone else is reading this and it creates a sense of imagined community and it's this imagined community that is the precondition for an imagined National community and I'll try and give you like a more it's hard to imagine it with reading because reading is something we all take for granted uh we learn as kids um we don't learn the way people used to which was kind of when they were older but okay in my generation like it was where were you on 9 11 because we all tuned in to you know we all tuned into the TV and saw this The Towers fall in real time and it really created a sense of community across America um that you were all seeing this momentous thing happen at the same time or the generation right before me the Challenger disaster of 1986 when the Challenger space shuttle exploded and everyone died and and it was being filmed because the space shuttle launches were still exciting then and everybody saw it explode at the same time or the assassination of JFK where everybody found out at the same time so basically I'm saying mass media creates simultaneous mass media which can be TV but in earlier times was reading uh was printed reading creates a sense of shared time that lets you imagine connections with people you don't see in physical reality before whatever imaginary Collective there was was about religion and like um Christians okay we're all Catholics we're all gonna celebrate Easter on the same day like Ramadan all Muslims are going to celebrate in the same month that they determine every year um according to the lunar calendar but it wasn't like an everyday thing that you could just access any time the way reading was so that's where I would that's where I would draw like the first big requirement of nationalism um the second requirement of nationalism was a sense that dynastic rule that is rule by that rule was not given by God that rulership was not given by God and this really happened in Europe in the wake of the front of the first the British revolution in the 1600s the British Civil War rather it's called the British Civil War and then in America the American Revolution and then the French Revolution these revolutions all gave people a sense that oh wait a second we can we can overthrow a king and it had never been done before so if you're going to overthrow a king that means that you're all kind of coming it's one of those things where reality creates ideology it's like sort of the lived experience of overthrowing a king of overthrowing a monarchy created the idea of democracy for people I mean the upper classes had maybe read about Greek and Roman uh democracy but it wasn't something that was real that was lived experience and um ironically the first the first step towards that was religious dissension in England where the in the you know the English Reformation by this by the 17th century most people in England had converted to anglicanism to some sort of protestantism basically but the king um James Stewart II the king went back to being Catholic and people were just like nah nah you can't do that like you no longer represent us and they uh they literally overthrew him because he converted his religion and before that but there had to have been kind of this already existing National Consciousness established by Printing and reading and by the Bible having been translated into English the King James Bible um so it was kind of ironic for like what the what the father did screws up the sun like James the first had the bible translated into English the famous English like famous King James Bible English version and then this kind of created this natural Consciousness which when uh James the first um I'm sorry grandson when he converted back to Catholicism people were like no no sorry you you gave us the Protestant Bible you gave us all this stuff and now you're going back no whereas before that you had no the idea that you questioned your ruler's religion was crazy um so I'm gonna pause there because that's like a natural stop and we're gonna do the French Revolution the 19th century and World War One

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

hi welcome to week 11 uh International Studies 2100 and this week we're going to continue a discussion of the nation state and nationalism so this is nation state National is in part two I will be giving Professor po-drag's lecture from her notes in the first half and then in the second half of this lecture Professor podrug will be joining us this state is a set of Institutions it has a monopoly on violence and Rule making the idea of a modern state developed after 1648. before this date there were pre-modern States where government was controlled by hyperlocal aristocracies and it was based on feudalism and Aristocrats who shared power with the universal Catholic Church this Arrangement was fragmented and broken up by the Protestant Reformation and the religious wars of the 16th and 17th century and with the conclusion of those Wars um it was the birth of the modern State and modern state is a state with absolute sovereignty and Consolidated monarchical Powers this occurred after 1648 which was the end of the 30 Years War and the Pisa was failure this was also out of these wars came the idea of national sovereignty so I'll explain this in Greater detail later in the lecture after the American and French revolutions moved over 1776 1789 um legitimacy of the state and government is taken from an idea of some kind of popular sovereignty where rulers represent a nation a linguistically culturally historically United people as opposed to rulers representing their own interest in ruling over the idea of the nation-state came from Europe which is why we are talking and these this election lecture before about Europe let's talk about traditional system of government and pre-modern States from 800s to the 16th century that's the 1500s um was a period where we can think of a traditional system of political rule that is hereditary and based on feudalism so feudalism is where Mutual promises or Oaths are taken um by members of a hereditary military cast that rules over peasants so vassals take Oaths to Lloyds in return for posters of land and a right to pass on this land to a firstborn son 's heads up vassals and at the bottom of the order was a peasant who received a right to farm in return for surrendering some part of his Harvest and providing obligatory labor this was called the Kobe system so the king in this kind of government is merely the head of the Lords and Lords can in turn against him they can put a new family in place for example this happened during the English War of the Roses the Ottoman Empire had a similar system so local Lords received tributes from the Sultan in the Istanbul to protect peasants from Warlords the local Lords were bound to the salt and by oath in Europe and Japan these possessions were hereditary in the Ottoman Empire every new sergeant could give out new or recall iodes assigned policies of that so the details differed a little bit but the idea was the same across uh different areas of the world the city and the country will roared differently independent city-states had overlords but they also had City Charters and rights and they paid tribute in the form of money rather than paying uh tribute to a King in the form of Labor of goods The Peasants were required to do so there were different laws within the city and outside of the city in the countryside surfs were legally tied to the land that a local Lloyd had rights over if they managed to run away and hide in the city they were given the freedom it was just saying the city air makes you free uh the production system yeah I would go to projection system needed a guaranteed population to farm and the surf system was one way to do that uh but there were always too many people um so people fled to the cities and cities in fact were not demographically self-sustaining they didn't did not reproduce the population they needed to maintain their existing population until the 19th century so in Europe the Catholic church had a lot of power that we would normally think it was properly belonging to States Catholic Church operated independently from Kings Lords vassals that controlled posters of landed territory and the church could themselves excommunicate rulers furthermore the church owned one-third of total arable land in Europe so they had a lot of economic power during these Middle Ages they had Social Power because any social welfare in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance was exclusively collected and distributed by the church in Church parishes parishes and you've heard of the 10 tithe um and this was a tax given directly to the church and it was a tax that supported uh widows hospitals other kinds of social welfare that was not the responsibility of Kings or vassals uh or rulers that was the responsibility of the church so what we think of as responsibility of nation state was actually split among multiple actors in medieval and Renaissance period the church's dominance was based on the idea of the universal Catholic church and so you learned a couple weeks ago in the Casanova chapter uh that the Catholic Church became transnational after Vatican II in 1963 and I want to emphasize a Casanova came to this conclusion because he was comparing the church after 1963 to the church's geopolitical position and strength in the 1700s and 1800s and which is the 18th and 19th century um what we are talking about when we talk about the Catholic Church having the universal Catholic Church of the medieval and Renaissance period is a period That's much earlier from the 9th to the 17th century and it the church was in a different much stronger position uh at that point and so during the medieval period the Catholic church in Western Europe was Universal it was transnational in the sense that its values and dominance were believed to be relevant and Optical everywhere on the globe um there was no such thing as transnational at the time because simply there was no concept of the nation um that we've talked about developing in the in the 18th centuries um and 19th centuries so this dominance of the Catholic church it was undone by Martin Luther's protestantism Luther rejected the Catholic Church's right to separate political power and ownership of the land um so for instance priests and nuns were only subject to ephesiastical jurisdiction to the jurisdiction of the Courts of of it of the church courts not the local Court Luther believed that this Arrangement uh had made the church corrupt that the church the Catholic church had obtained too much a worldly power uh that was one he went and he banged uh his Theses on a church door and he started protestantism locals saw that Luther's preaching benefited them some local Aristocrats because uh according to his ideas uh they no longer had to share power with the Catholic Church according to Luther's interpretation so uh in in protest in countries that became the state dissolved monasteries and it took over the land Holdings and this was the beginning of the destruction of the universal Christian Church in the Middle Ages again hopping back the Middle Ages in Europe there existed this dual world view uh one that was very hyper local to just the local law that controlled the the land that you gave tribute to and and then also there was this other idea of the universal United Christian Catholic Church a dual world view this is similar in Islam too there were local Lords in the ottoman Empires but there was also a vision that everyone uh would be converted and Islam was into this kind of universe Islam would create this Universal Uma nation states are the opposite a nation state only exists as part of a system or community of other nation-states so no Frenchman wants the entire world to be fetched um there's no sense of a worldwide or Universal unity in the nation-state system in the 16th and 17th centuries the series of catastrophic uh religious wars across years Europe they culminated in the 80 years war um which was a Dutch war of independence that lasted until 1648 and in local um near the local Netherlands had converted to protestantism but the Catholic habsburgs who were Spanish ruled them uh the habsburgs were trying to outlaw protestantism and reconvert people to Catholicism then there was this second religious War um which was a 30 Years War from 1618 to 6 to 1648 and this war Drew in every monarchy in Europe the habsburgs tried to take back the Confederacy of the Holy Roman Empire and reimposed Catholicism on these little duketims that had made up this Confederacy the smog dukes and kingdoms resisted military this idea of the Catholic Church coming back to those conflict between Catholics and Protestants um but the alliances were not actually organized by religion in fact by the end of it you had the French against the Habsburg even though both were catholic in the 30 years war that ended in 1648 30 of the population was killed in the conflict or died due to starvation and parts of Germany became reforested because so many agricultural areas and towns were wiped out eight million people died and we're talking about 16 uh 18 to 1648. so this war exhausted comebacks and so much that they find the uh signed a peace treaty the Peace of West philia that ended their conflict and in this piece of wine parties agreed never to meddle in each other's Affairs again so this introduced for the first time this concept of whoever's territory it was to determine the religion of the territory a piece of West philia led to decline in the further Define an authority of the Catholic church over the lives of people um religious tolerance at the time was not necessarily considered a good thing but the destruction of the war was so great that this treaty established a principle of religious tolerance and this war also destroyed the agitated Elites faith and finding all the answers in scriptures because it really just destroyed um Europe so this was the beginning of um the enlightenment when thinker's turned to skepticism and empirical observation rather than trying to derive from uh you know truth from theology first or truth from the Bible or from theological principles um so this attitude set up the enlightenment it led to the Scientific Revolution and eventually the Industrial Revolution that's why this is an important point to remember uh these these changes in uh ideas about what uh and the creation of these Concepts like sovereignty and uh religious tolerance that set the stage for the idea of of states and States having sovereignty so just to repeat in pre-modern States the church could meddle individuals in any one location could have multiple Masters because they were ruled by the local lowered by A King by the church but the priests of Australia would established the conception of sovereign states with fixed boundaries and one state does not meddle in the internal governance and Internal Affairs of any other state so this idea of national Sovereign nation-states um governs the Western World all the way until World War II when it was replaced by essentially the United Nations system and Multinational agreements but up until World War II really had this idea of just the release States acting in this world system and they interacted with each other so one of the results of this was that nation was it Nation States became more bureaucratized uh the special charters of city-states that existed in medieval and Renaissance times were reversed land owning aristocracy which in fact it was a source of armies um lost power and they relinquished a lot of the power to the monarch there was also this simultaneous move from the calvary of horses to infantry that was partly due to the development and use of gunpowder and infantry became more important um but more infantry required more people um and you couldn't do what you used to do when you weighed your world which was sending Cavalry and few people and live off the land um and as you went you you just uh acquired goods and land but you actually uh needed a larger number of people that were infantry and you ended up having to have a Central State that paid for soldiers um and paid wages and um this also helped to centralize um Power and you know the ability to wage war and violence it no longer no longer could a duke or some small Duke Dums each put together their own Army and do what they wanted to uh you you uh had a centralized centralization of military power up so part of this shift was technology and part was The Logical War but the point is that smaller States became Consolidated into larger units so this new class emerged which was a professional bureaucracy Kings took literate members of the merchant class uh in return for service as state bureaucrats so these uh this Merchant class that literate members became a new class of nobility that was dependent for the money and the jobs and the rank social Bank on the Monarch the existing ability uh that was based in agriculture and rights to land ownership um which was called the nobility of the robe as opposed to the nobility uh uh it was I'm sorry that that was called the nobility of the sword right you think land horse armor as opposed to the nobility of the robe meaning us people that had gained some agitation and became Noble by becoming part of the state and bureaucrats so this concept of sovereignty then merge after 1648 and what established the International System embodies a number of Concepts so I'm going to summarize and read from the Stanford encyclopedia philosophy the definition of sovereignty sovereignty came to mean in early modern Europe supreme authority within a territory this is the quality that early modern States possessed but which popes Emperors Kings Bishops and most Nobles ambassadors during the Middle Ages lacked so there are three elements of sovereignty and the entry continues and I quote first a holder of Avanti possesses Authority not merely coercive power rather the right according to philosopher R.P wolf the light command and correlatively the right to be obeyed right connoting legitimacy a hoarder of sovereignty derives Authority from some mutually acknowledged source of legitimacy natural law a Divine mandate if hereditary lie a constitution even international law second this Authority is supreme authority so Supremacy is what makes the Constitution of the United States for example Superior to um the government of Pennsylvania or any holder of sovereignty um below that a hoarder of sovereignty is superior to all authorities under its purview so Supremacy um is this idea that one uh individual of one Authority uh holds supreme authority over lower levels it's endemic to modernity as we described during the Middle Ages uh manafort authorities held some sort of legal warrant for the authority uh but those authorities didn't were not uh Supreme uh so in modern times Authority is supreme in the nation state held in one body finally the last part is element is territoriality and territoriality is a principle by which members of Community are to be defined it's been again I'm quoting from the Stanford encyclopedia it specifies that their membership derives from the residents within borders membership is defined in a way that may not correspond with identity the borders of a sovereign state may not at all circumscribe a particular people actually or a nation or as if we talked about the house for the Empire the main factor accomplished many different identities many different nations um um or consider even uh in the recent history Yugoslavia which was composed of croats albanians Subs even the Loma all these first three now have their own countries do not actually they're a unique uh National Group nationality all over Europe so it is valid by simple virtue of their location with the geographic borders that people belong to a state and fall under the authority of its ruler it is within a geographic territory that modern sovereigns are supremely authoritative so nowadays territoriality is deeply taken for granted it's a feature of authority across all across the globe and even supernational and international institutions like the European Union or the United Nations are composed of States whose memberships are in turn defined territoriality we can contrast this idea with something like the wandering tribe uh so think of the Jewish people's prior to 1948 when this state of Israel was established or think of the codes today who are people that live across turkey Iraq and Syria uh whose authority structures completely disassociated from any particular piece of land um so uh it's helpful to think of the the whole range of how territoriality um nowadays of groups who do not have nation states uh intersect with nation states that have supreme authority and authority so the general definition of sovereignty again is supreme authority within a territory so there are three uh dimensions of sovereignty that are also Imports into uh consider so what do you think about Sovereign do you think about where it's hell let's think of different examples sovereignty can be held in an individual um so for example like monarch who is above the law or it can be held out so it can be held in an institution like uh in uh presidency and the Congress and the institutions of our democracy sovereignty is held there sovereignty can be absolute or non-absolute absoluteness does not refer to the extent or character the sovereignty because we said sovereignty is always Supreme rather absolute non-absolute refers to the scope of matters over which a photo of authority is sovereign so today many uh European Union member states exhibit non-absoluteness they are sovereign in governing defense but uh they have this uh but they're not sovereign in governing their currencies or trade policies there's so many social welfare policies because uh these are develop and administer cooperation with a European Union that they are part of and it's actually set forth in European Union law the Third Dimension is the relationship to Outsiders uh whether it's internal sovereignty or external sovereignty so to quote again from this um this encyclopedia Sovereign authorities exercise within borders but also by definition with respect to Outsiders who may not interfere with the Sovereign governance so um external sovereignty depends on the recognition by Outsiders of your sovereignty so for example Israel doesn't recognize Palestine um and Israel itself has not been recognized by Iran since 1978 so in this sense it it doesn't uh have external sovereignty with in these countries so there are three problems with um sovereignty nowadays when it's a female modern democratic theory um and these problems are the basis for the challenges that globalization posed to nation states which we're going to talk about uh later on uh in part two of this week and also in the following week um and in fact these challenges the globalization uh present uh in many ways undermine the legitimacy of the nation my Kane is paraphrased again in Stanford encyclopedia entry says that sovereignty gives rise to three dysfunctionalities first is the external dimension of sovereignty vendors inconceivable this idea of international law or a world State or the U.N and international law um and so when we have the UN and we have multinational level we have the wtl um we have these institutions they uh conflict with this like they take away from the idea of not National sovereignty the second is the internal dimension of sovereignty um the absolute power of the state over the body politics results in centralism not pluralism essentially uh you have not many different in a nation-state um because sovereignty is absolute uh that can lead to centralizing uh and holding of all power within a small Core Group um not the idea that there are many different groups um that interact in complex ways um and have plural identities and plural uh kinds of uh rights and sovereignties themselves the third is um the problem with the Democratic notion of accountability compared to the idea of Supreme sovereignty the supreme power of the sovereign state is contrary to the Democratic notion of accountability in fact because the traditional concept of sovereignty contradicts the shared moral concepts of citizenry uh and the ability of citizens to constrain the choices of the sovereign so our traditional definition of sovereignty that develops after 1648 um is important for us to understand in order to then think about how the nation stay upon which is built upon this idea of national sovereignty uh is now being challenged by ideas of democracy that polity that may accept the nation state uh holds dear uh by and by other forms of Engagement in a global world they're developed into World War II like international law quick history of how we get from 1648 uh which is the development of the idea of national sovereignty of national states that don't interfere in each other's internal uh decisions um and how that uh moved through history and those ideas developed through history and brings us to approximately uh the French Revolution so after the 30 Years War it was a belief that this old political system that ruled in the medieval period was no longer viable ah that this idea of War of all against all was no longer viable Thomas Hobbes many of you have heard of him uh was vote in the aftermath of the English Civil War he well in this book Leviathan 1651 uh you probably have heard this quote that the state of nature is anarchy it is nasty brutish and short that's Thomas Hobbes um and the only way to avoid this war of all against all is to have according to Hobbes one ruler with no descent so this was the beginning he's one of the first um to look at the what happened in the 30 years war in the 80 years war and started to think about political Theory and how to govern the specific beginning of of governance thinking about governance so between 1648 and 1789 uh you had this development political thought that grappled with the relationship between the government and the governing you had a declaration for example the Declaration of the Rights of Man the idea that uh people had Rights was new and it came out of this period did not exist before that there was a rise after 1648 in centralized monarchies in France in Russia Prussia is now Germany in Russia in Great Britain and one major driver of this consolidation of powers was war um as we talked about small-scale Warfare uh or there was a lot small-scale Warfare over boundaries which caused the competition with other states in military manufacturing they created a demand for an industrial base to create a demand for standard system of measurements when you create a lot of things um uh you moved away from handicrafts toward industrialization um at the same time you had Peter the Great who created a new City Saint Petersburg he did this in order to cut off power from the Orthodox church and the Boyers um the Orthodox Church maintained controlled by forbidding mass communication in fact forbid Printing and reading it wasn't it was only Peter the Great who brought impresses and experts from trash in Sweden and Netherlands uh and he did this to overcome traditional uh he the power of the Orthodox Catholic church again we see that so in Russia the same kind of thing playing out where um the church lost uh Power um eventually to a secular State and you had to development of a national identities um the Europe so the European States we've talked about this at the beginning of this class they received they gained a lot of money from remote controlism from silver gold mines in the new world they use these proceeds to engage in transatlantic trade and they developed an industrial base that uh was encouraged because there were these captive markets and colonies um and the the this industrial base developed because they wanted to arm and uh and Supply their armies to fight each other right because Colonial expansion also had this element of an armed space uh and European powers wanted to grow and enlarge themselves but um this arms race these wars they were driven by colonialism was one more driver of State consolidation in Europe with the consolidation of territories under a centralized powers so European powers in the 1600s to 17th centuries they tightened the control of the colonies they used these colonies um to control their own Affairs um there may not have been direct taxation or controlled by the mother country of a of a colony but they were uh but there was um control over the economic system um and when the metropolises um the metropolis and other countries tighten the control over colonies um this created tensions so for example we see this sudden Push by Great Britain to raise revenues um in the in the 18th century by tightening control over the 13 colonies and this was one of the contributing factors eventually led to the American Revolution so just to summarize um part two of the nation nationalism and Imagination State nation states rise out of the idea of Nations hey Rosa historical process is why we're talking I just gave you this history it's historical process in 1648. um power and authority in pre-modern States was distributed among military and political Elites Kings vassals and Aristocrats and then also the church and it was a negotiated uh the piece of Australia established an international system that was in effect in 1648 uh since 1945 and this was based on the idea of national ultimate uh Supreme National sovereignty so in the rest of of this week we're going to talk about the interplay between um lived experiences facts on the ground and um the creation of ideologies which established this new concept of the nation so not just the state but the nation state

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

so I call this part three Professor kotto is going to now join us um and she's going to explain how the nation state is a product of a combination of ideologies and particularly lived experiences that gave rise to new identities as part of their specific communities of people so people motivated by ideologies but these only arise and gain power from people's lives experiences um American Revolution just to help you understand what we're trying to say is a good example I briefly mentioned it a second ago um they had this lived experience of extensive of extensive local control they they really you know they had a governor that was um that was appointed by Great Britain but besides that there was a they controlled the local lives in over here across the Atlantic and then Great Britain decided that they wanted to impose direct taxation um and this only began in 1765 with a British Stamp Act um this was the first internal tax and it was an internal uh within the colonies it was the attacks on all printed documents so if the legal contracts was newspapers pamphlets playing cards they all had to be produced on specially stamped paper and this paper was produced in England on in Boston it had to be purchased from England um so this was the first attempt to really take away local control and this is why some historians say that the American Revolution began with the Stamp Act before the stab act American settlers had always thought of themselves as British and belonging to a colony of victim that was their identity every single individual in the in this part of the world they did not think of themselves as Americans until they experience the new facts on the ground of being taxed equally by the British everybody was taxed and uh this shared suffering or they should imposition um allowed them to begin to feel that they were connected to other colonists so new yeah people in New England or Boston were connected to people in in South Carolina because they're all suffering in the same way so that it was this British opposition that unified culturally very different and legally very different colonies so Professor project her lecture Begins by discussing the situation after 1648. when the medieval Catholic Church was no longer provided welfare and Protestant European States uh the executive State took over many of the laws that had previously been occupied the church and now we're going to switch something sort of had to replace that sense of community and as this as the modern state was getting more and more sort of active taking over things the church used to do for instance establishing universities establishing hospitals and also having like taking over administrative functions that the church had previously performed like for instance registering your birth at City Hall instead of at the local Parish that there needed to be some organizing kind of ideology or organizing set of beliefs or principles to get people to go along with that huge change and I wanted to start out by uh I've I've made this distinction last time as well but I think it's extremely important distinction so I'm just gonna restate it with some different terms and examples I want to make the distinction between Civic nationalism also known as a liberal nationalism it's really pretty much the same thing Civic nationalism liberal nationalism and ethnic nationalism or organic nationalism and Civic nationalism is actually what came first it was what was established in the American Revolution then the French Revolution and its key feature is that it is voluntaristic Civic nationalism is focused on the idea that the citizens of a given bounded territory will voluntarily assimilate to or acquire a set of common values um thus Civic nationalism and these values are sort of drawn from the popular will which is the will of the majority existing in that territory um so since Civic nationalism is focused on people's voluntary uh voluntarily coming together it can easily accept the idea of immigrants as long as those immigrants choose to assimilate this is the kind of nationalism that we see in the United States and even in France uh France is a good example because even though they uh they are a Nate they are sort of the state of the French Nation they're not defined as such and they've accepted many immigrants who've become president Nicolas Sarkozy if you remember him from a few years ago uh Hungarian Jewish descent not a French descent so that's Civic nationalism and the other point about Civic nationalism besides the fact that it's voluntaristic is that it is not inherently chauvinist or militaristic um according to Civic or liberal nationalism no one nation is objectively superior to any other Nation rather the nation is the most so it's not objectively Superior to any other Nation but you're subjectively supposed to have the most loyalty to it so it's not saying this nation is inherently better rather it's saying you need to have allegiance to whatever Nation you find yourself in um so no one nation is inherently Superior to any other Nation rather uh the nation is valuable as an organizing Principle as a concept because Civic nationalists think that it is the most natural way for people to come together in societies organized by the liberal ideals of human equality and individual human rights and this is because it will simply be easier and more natural for you as an individual to respect and care about the rights of everyone else in your Society even if you don't know them if you feel that despite the fact that you don't know them you do have something fundamental in common uh one of the major theorists of civil nationalism again don't worry too much about names and dates because I will I've been meaning to post it but I'll post it all as one I'll post all of my last lectures as one unit this weekend um one of the major theorists of Civic nationalism is this a 19th century philosopher eduard Ernest sorry Ernest renon who published the major work what is a nation in 1882 and he famously wrote that quote a nation is a group of individuals who have chosen to forget many things together and by that he meant to forget their differences so his example he was French um he he was a French Jewish his examples were the in order to become French the French had to forget the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572 and the violence of their 16th century Wars between Catholics and Protestants and French Jews had to forget how anti-semitic France had been and they all sort of had to kind of say Okay forgive and forget we're coming together uh Civic nationalism as you can see is inherently sort of interested in bringing together different social classes this is a great uh I picked this painting because I think it's a really great image of sort of the ideal of Civic nationalism this is Liberty this is a painting known as LIberty Leading the People um and it's sort of this personification of France who is a nude woman because it's hearkening back to classical Greek and Roman statuary uh where perfect idealized Figures were were always nude and she's wearing a little uh red stocking cap which is what the lower classes like the working classes would wear um to keep their hair together um in 18th and 19th Century Paris which is like very revolutionary in and of itself because you're combining the imagery of a perfect classical statue with the imagery of what was essentially at that time the equivalent of a do-rag right like it's like a weird mix and she's going forth instead of with a religious symbol like the cross she's going forth with the flag and you can see that she is being followed by people of various classes and ages um the gentleman with his black top hat that's the upper class uh the one behind him with a kind of workers Newsboys cap that is clearly Like A working class figure the the woman at her feet in a kerchief is clearly a peasant so it's saying let's forget our differences and come together now the main Civic nationalism began in the late 18th century and even though we think of nationalism as a European phenomenon it really began it actually came to fruition first in the United States so this is just a famous painting of the constitutional convention uh in 1776. now it's important to note that Civic nationalism began in the late 18th century when already existing and defined administrative territories overthrew their previous hereditary monarchical overlords in order to create States based on popular sovereignty so in in the American Revolution you already had the defined territories of the 13 colonies which already had local administrative systems in place overthrow their colonialist overlords the British king in Parliament because they felt like uh the British king no wrong no longer reflected their what was best for them their interests and it was the success of the American Revolution which shocked the world and reverberated back across the Atlantic to France where the educated classes had been becoming increasingly increasingly disappointed in how the King was running things and so there was an explosion of printed materials criticizing the king for involving the nation in small territorial Wars and raising taxes and in this case they come together to overthrow the King this is a famous painting of the Tennis Court Oath where um the Estates General which was like a representative but not very powerful body before the monarchy was overthrown coming together and swearing the oath that they are not going to leave they're not going to leave this uh bizarrely it was it happened at the king's tennis court in Versailles outside of Paris that they're not going to leave until they come together and successfully write a constitution the Divine defines who owes who what and how the government is going to function and this is like the third characteristic of Civic nationalism which is that it is always based on a constitution and on the idea of an explicit social contract uh where basically all the individuals in society are deciding are deciding to see their um are deciding to seed their complete Independence in order to follow the what Rousseau called Jean-Jacques Rousseau called the general will the will of the majority and to a government and that this government is only legitimate in so far as it continues to reflect the will of the majority and what do we leave it with let's go back to this because I think this is just a really good image and so I want to note that the French Revolution of 1789 now also the territory of the kingdom of France it was already Consolidated the administration of the kingdom of France the bureaucracy it was already in place so Civic nationalism typically takes like an existing territory and it just changes the rulers it takes people that were there through hereditary principle or other principles and it replaces them with um kind of Legally legitimized constitutional rulers and the last uh the third major example of this at this time would be the Revolutionary Wars of Independence in South America when Colonial territories that had been previously administered directly by Spain you remember like the mercantilism section they revolted to create the independent states of South America that we know today what's interesting is that the states formed in South America were not formed on the basis of ethnic groups because that every place was a different mix of um spanish immigrants the descendant of spanish immigrants who were called Creoles and various native peoples and also African slaves and their descendants that have been brought over every place was kind of a different mix but instead the South America was divided according to the administrative divisions that had existed as Spanish colonies so it was really like okay this administrative unit decides to seek Independence and that administrative unit decides to seek Independence and it's not about sort of what the ethnic composition is and uh the most famous you know kind of the beginning of these revolutionary Wars of independence of South America were the began with the transformation of the Spanish colony of new Granada into the state of grand Colombia by the revolutionary leader Simone Bolivar in 1918 and it was this uh it kind of it encompassed what is today Panama Ecuador Colombia Venezuela and later it was divided up but so these are Civic nationalisms and later in the 19th century you get ethnic nationalisms now Civic nationalism liberal nationalism voluntaristic ethnic nationalism is also known as known as organic nationalism because it means that you don't get to choose like you don't get to choose it's based on your descent it's based on who your parents were it's not necessarily based on where you live you could be living in different administrative units you could be living in territories even separated by space by different by you know different uh map by Mountain rages territories that aren't even necessarily geographically contiguous um but it is based on dissent and this was sort of harder to create because obviously the administrative structures were not in place and these were these nationalisms were born out of the conquests of Napoleon so let me get to him so Napoleon like there's a lot said about him he was kind of a sociopath and that he didn't care how many of his men died um but he's significant because he kind of he takes over the French Revolution after the French Revolution fractures between the the Jacobins and the and the girondis who want sort of different levels of representation of the lower classes and the way that the French Revolution leads to basically I just want to point out the French Rebel American Revolution create like is the world's first example of Civic nationalism it kind of inspires the uppercloud literate upper classes who are unhappy with the way the monarchy is going in France to create the French Revolution now when the French Revolution happens all of France's neighbors are so threatened by the idea that there's this Republic that's overthrown its king and beheaded him and that is now making laws instead of just taking laws that were always there they're so threatened by it that even though they are enemies uh England and Prussia they all come together in order to invade France and try to overthrow the Republic and bring back well they can't bring back Louis XVI because he's dead but to bring back like his nephew to bring back the bourbon Dynasty and so to bring back the idea of okay dynastic hereditary and legitimacy of government not popular sovereignty legitimacy of government and when these neighbors invade France that sort of creates among the French who were previously had very strong regional identities it creates among the French um supporters of the Revolution the middle classes and the lower classes a real sense of national Unity as they have to fight off these Invaders so this is the third point of this class which is how Warfare can CR how the experience of warfare can create now National Unity so they come together to fight off their Invaders and for the very first time in history you have what is known as the LA Bay and Mas which is General conscription which is that every single male citizen which is every single male is forced to join the Army basically the Republicans in France are dealing with the fact that these professional armies of their dynastic Royal traditional neighbors are invading them they don't have the professionals because the professionals are the aristocracy are on the side of the upper class and against the revolution but what they have is numbers so they kind of constrict conscript everyone and throw a bunch of men at the problem and over seven eight years this group of kind of Citizen soldiers actually becomes an army it's a similar process to how the sort of uh you know Farmers the raw recruits that Washington brought together in the American Revolution over the course of the war of independence became a professional Army so this Army ends up kind of becoming the resonator like it ends up kind of not just fighting for Republican France but becoming the point of France in some way and the the most successful General in that Army Napoleon ends up sort of becoming the he calls himself the console because they're trying to use Republican terminology but effectively he kind of becomes a military dictator and he decides that he's going to conquer Europe and his explanation for this is that he's going to bring the French the values of French Civic nationalism to the rest of the world that the people of the world need to be liberated that the lower middle and lower classes of the world need to be liberated from their aristocratic monarchical rulers and that as he conquers Europe he's going to create a series of republics and uh he's he's spectacularly successful in battle uh there's a ton of battles but just the most important ones in 1805 the Battle of austerlitz he defeats the Habsburg monarchy you remember the habsburgs are still running the uh are still running Austria as well as they have they're leaving the con the German Holy Roman Empire Confederacy so he defeats them in 1806 he defeats an assortment of German all those little German principalities I was telling you about that formed the Confederacy known as the the kind of hereditary Confederacy of dynastic States in Germany known as the Holy Roman Empire and at that point the Holy Roman Empire that has existed for a thousand years since Charlemagne uh is destroyed and he replaces it with something called the Confederacy of the rhyme and he starts you know try sending in French bureaucrats to try to manage these conquered territories and it's interesting because the reaction to Napoleon's conquest of he conquers first he conquers uh Germany he conquers Italy he conquers Spain the reaction is mixed some people uh find it sort of like the invasion of an aggressor but other other people uh other locals welcome it because it's overthrowing their oppressive rulers um and you get all these little republics that suddenly have constitutions they sort of take that model of the French Revolution and they have they set up constitutions and they create their own little proto-states um but then he sort of takes things too far maybe it would have worked out like this maybe it would have worked out where Europe would have had a bunch of little republics and France would have sort of been the first of equals among them but then he takes it too far and he's because he himself is focused on Military glory for him the sort of the spreading of the ideals of of fraternity and equality of individual rights is just an excuse and he invades Russia which is like a mistake people keep making uh like that was also how Hitler lost uh uh 120 years later where he invades Russia and he doesn't really it he his his plan is for his soldiers to live off the land the Russians simply Retreat right they simply retreat they even let him take their Capital Moscow and they burn Moscow will they themselves burn their own main city in order to keep Napoleon from um rein from like uh provisioning his army from like feeding them and clothing them and so he comes to Moscow he's hundreds of miles away from his supply lines and he has nothing to eat and winter is starting because the Russian winter comes early and it's October so that destroys Napoleon like he eventually has to his men are starving and Frozen and they eventually have to retreat and the armies of the Tsar follow him all the way back to Paris this is exactly what happens it's really weird that Hitler made the same mistake it's exactly what happens after World War II and here is the point of this Napoleon is now beaten by Confederacy of Russia Prussia Austria led by Russia but it creates ethnic the experience of War of invasion by Napoleon and then as that at first it's kind of like he's there to put in republics but the longer his soldiers stay the more they like eat the crops and take everyone's resources the more resentment they provoked and he creates for the first time in these previously dynastic states of Russia Prussia and Austria a sense of nationalism a sense of ethnic nationalism that they are all uh different from the French different than the Invaders and these countries also have to raise Mass armies to fight him so this is kind of what I'm trying to point out is that it was this necessity of creating mass armies that led to National identification sorry let me go back here um and this was the dot besides the rise of the Industrial Revolution which uh Professor Dennis has talked about Elaine with Marxism besides the the Industrial Revolution the other major development in the 19th century is that Europe stops looking like it did before with these boundaries that wouldn't be recognizable to us because they're just dynastic States and it develops pretty much very similar boundaries to what it has today as individual Nations fight for their uh National self-determination and the two most prominent examples of this are Germany and Italy we can start with Italy because it's a great um it's a great example of kind of a country it's someplace I'm sure you'll all be at some point as tourists and it's sort of one of the most famous countries in the world because it's so beautiful beautiful and it just had the good fortune that a lot of its old stuff was preserved but most people don't know that Italy itself as a nation state is extremely recent Italy was not unified until 1861 and it wasn't completely territorially unified until 1871. so the Italy was just a bunch of principalities with different dynastic rulers but when Napoleon conquered them he gave them this idea of wait a second we could do away with all this and we could have one National culture it was like a long process from when he it was it took a full 60 years from when he invaded them for them to kind of overcome internal political resistance and create a state but it was really that uh Invasion that prompted it and the same thing in Germany um in the 1860s uh Germany one German State out of all the many little principalities of the Holy Roman Empire Prussia takes over and is like okay we're going to unify Germany under our monarchy and they start they have this large army that they raised to fight Napoleon and they're absorbing all these small duchies and principalities and in a lot of cases they're successful because the local middle class of those the bird the so-called Burger class the people living in the cities um are thinking you know the aristocracy of this tiny little this tiny little dachi I live in is not really benefiting me and in fact I I'm sort of interested in the idea of being unified for reasons of language and also for reasons of trade that's the other bigger the big drivers of nationalism are the development of literacy where people get a sense of commonality through language as as literacy develops uh and as there are more and more printing presses more and more books more and more people read and they sort of identify with the language that they're reading in the other driver is Warfare as people react to Napoleon's invade as these peoples react to Napoleon's invasion and the third driver is regional trade because these principalities are so small that and trade is in you know TR indust an industrial base takes a larger involves larger regions than just an agricultural base and these old principalities are a real block if you want to for instance take goods from if you're a merchant and you want to take goods from Bavaria in Southern and South Eastern Germany to swabia and Southwestern Germany you have to go through a ton of customs and duties and tolls because it's not United so the merchant class is really thinking the class that's driving the Industrial Revolution the merchant class is really thinking hey let's support um the invading the invading armies of Prussia because Prussia the Kingdom of Prussia can unify us into Germany and it's the Prussian hohen salern Dynasty that unifies Germany in 1870. and the the fun thing that it does to sort of give people I wouldn't say fun the very characteristic of nationalism thing that it does is after it's eaten up all of the little states of the Holy Roman Empire the Prussian armies now the German armies say okay let's conquer part of France because in the experience of fighting an enemy we will solidify our own identity and so they invade France and they conquer the French region of azath Loren which is right on the border between France and Germany it's this very large uh both industrially productive because of coal mines and uh agriculturally productive region and they literally conquer it to sort of say look at what we as a germination can accomplish in our in the living memory of some of the oldest members of our society we were conquered by the French but not because we were disunited but now that we are united we are having our revenge and so the Declaration the official Declaration of German unity and the promulgation of the German Constitution which is at that point a kind of have legalized constitutional monarchy like Britain is proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors in the French Palace of Versailles as a deliberate kind of Fu to the French and so we see how this is a kind of nationalism that rather than seeking to um have some sort of dialogue that it's rather than saying okay let's just divide each other administratively into Nations for kind of governmental purpose this nationalism is saying no no no um we're we transcend administrative units we are based on common language and culture and we are also better than you like we are in we are here to beat other nations so this is kind of repeated throughout the 19th century the other example that I want to give because I'm making ethnic nationalism sound all bad in it sort of chauvinism versus other nations the other example I want to talk about is Italy which was not really it didn't have a large enough Army to try to pull off what pressure what I'm sorry what what the you newly United Germany did and invade other countries it had a kind of pacifist I wouldn't say pacifist it had an ethnic nationalism not based on war but simply based on uniting disparate administrative units into one nation that would be defined by the Italian language and by a unified culture um and this the problem was that here again you had one Kingdom that had the largest army one of the constituents sort of in kingdoms of what we know today is Italy which was the kingdom of Piedmont and Sardinia they sort of they have the largest armies and middle class kind of Italian intellectuals from across the Italian Peninsula from different kingdoms come to the king uh Charles Emanuel Carlo Emmanuela of piamonte Sardinia and which is today on the border of what of Italy and France um kind of an Alpine area and they tell him hey look Italy needs to be United um you have the strongest army you can be our Prussia like you can if you invade the other kingdoms they will topple we promise you the support of the urban middle class of the industrialists even of the lower aristocracy basically of anyone who isn't the upper aristocracy associated with the monarchy and so you have Charles Emanuel and uh literally conquer the rest of Italy but not to expand piamonte but rather to create a unified Italy and he shows his commitment to this unified Italy by moving his capital from Turin which was the capital Sardinia to first to Florence and then after they conquer Rome from the pope because the pope had actually ruled Rome as not just a religious leader but literally as the kind of king of Rome you could say after they conquer Rome in 1871 they moved the capital to Rome so in this case kind of the Dynasty makes a sacrifice of its own sort of origins in order to come into a larger National idea and then once Italy is created one of the kind of guys that came up with the idea of Italian unification this very famous leader called Massimo dazeria he says okay now we now that we have made Italy we must make Italians because of course the people that were conscious of being Italians were the people that could read standard Italian I.E the upper and middle classes peasants still spoke dialogue still kind of lit were not literate We're Not educated and we're hyper local they were still effectively um the middle class was living in the modern quote unquote world of the 19th century while the peasants were living in at the same time in a hyper local world of the Middle Ages where their sense of identity was tied to their Village and their Parish so Italy had to make a extremely concerted effort to establish National Consciousness throughout its population not just in the upper and middle classes and it did this by a huge program of it did this in in two ways um one by a huge program of national welfare and infrastructure and two by creating an army whose main purpose until World War One the main purpose of the Italian army in the world war one was not two they didn't fight any wars between 1870 and World War One rather the purpose of the army was literally to draft people from all the different parts of Italy and teach them to speak and read standard Italian and to bring regiments were they had Universal conscription so that all men were required of all classes were required to go into the army and while they were in the Army for this fixed period of three years four years they deliberately mixed people from different regions North with South um mountain with plain all these different regions coming peasant with with City dweller and taught them to read and write standard Italian and taught them kind of what is it to be Italian so that they would have it was really people's lived experience in the military that created loyalty among voters who at that point of course were not women they were men so by having each man go through the lived experience of the army and of conscription they create a sense of national identity and the Army is really there not to defend Italy which Italy is allied with Great Britain and Great Britain really has uh Italy's mostly uh in the north it's protected by the Alps it's really hard to invade from the north the rest of it is Coastline protected by the British Navy so the Army isn't there to defend Italy it's not there to conquer other places it's their sort of universal educate educational Institution and then slowly after that after they've kind of had the Army come together they start building schools and building hospitals and replacing the Privileges of the church and there is this huge internal Fight Within Italy where the pope is extremely angry that his monasteries are getting uh dissolved that the state is coming in and disbanding monasteries and confiscating their land and this was done much earlier in northern Europe in the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century but in southern Europe it's not until the 19th century that this happens and by taking the by dissolving the monasteries and taking their land the government is not only giving itself a new major source of Revenue because remember the church owns a third of the land but it is also taking people's loyalties over because previously where you would go to your local kind of Monastery or Parish if you were poor or widowed or disabled now that's been taken over and there's like a little government office that is meeting out welfare to people so it's replacing it's giving people benefits from the state versus from the church and this actually has a ton of really nice positive benefits uh the church never really gave a about educating people it just wanted its clergy to be educated and now for the first time the Italian State cares that Italians are educated because again remember it is only by speaking and writing a standard language that you that you can feel yourself to be part of an ethnic Nation so they actually for the first time in Italian History established primary and secondary education for everybody uh the state is also much more interested in the alleviating suffering on a mass scale by establishing infrastructure the church was interested in Saving individual souls and it did a really good job of dispersing charity to individuals of taking tithes from the upper classes from the nobility like requiring anyone or and the merchants basically requiring anyone with money to tithe and then collecting that money and distributing it to the poor is like here's a meal for you here's a meal for you but they just didn't have kind of because they were focused on the next life and not on this life they didn't have the concept of like hey instead of giving people fish let's you know build some fish farms and teach them how to fish so the state comes in and it's it's the size and administrative power of the state and also its interest in this worldly concerns because the church is okay that you and I'm saying this as a Catholic so I feel like I can say it um on some level the Catholic church at least the Catholic Church before Vatican II the 19th and early 20th century Catholic Church is okay if you have a physically miserable life as long as you know you pray the right way and your soul is going to be saved because the focus is on the next life and not on this one but the TR but the state is like no no no we are here to represent the people in the here and now so we care about their well-being and the here and now and the Italian state starts to do things like it builds sewer systems it builds hospitals that actually follow principles of medicine rather than just giving people a nice place to die and the great the 19th century was characterized by huge epidemics of Cholera uh one epidemic of Cholera devastated New York City actually in 1830 and is what led to the creation of the protein Aqueduct uh so just as you as New Yorkers you know that this happened here too but uh the 19th century is devastated by cholera and it is in Italy cholera is finally eradicated by the state just through providing people with clean water so I want and providing people with clean water it really is an outgrowth of State intervention and also of national Consciousness because you suddenly have this sort of missionary impulse where people from the educated upper classes and the north of Italy was much more urbanized and had many more educated kind of professional technocratic people and had many more Engineers than the south of Italy it had these people saying like Okay I'm I may be from uh Torino I may be from bologna but I'm going to go and live I'm going to go and I'm going to move to Sicily or I'm going to move to Naples because I want to help build their sewer systems I want to help build their aqueducts I want to help build their schools and their roads because I feel a commonality with them so that is the beautiful kind of Integrative uh aspect of nationalism and just to make this even more pointed I'll give you two very brief examples example one uh we've done Italy but I'll give you two other examples exam uh a good example is Prussia Prussia we think of Prussia as this very militaristic state but it literally it is the first state in the world to create a social welfare system because it wants to have a sense of national Unity so that when it can scripts soldiers these soldiers feel a sense that the state is taking care of them and that they're really gonna like fight to The Bitter End for their state um in Russia similarly nobody gives a about the peasants none of the Russian upper classes give a pardon my language about the peasants until they're invaded by Napoleon and they need to create a mass Army to fight back so it is the necessity of creating a citizen Army that causes the upper classes to care about the lower classes and we're done with 19th century nationalism and now in just five minutes the bad side of nationalism the bad side of nationalism is pretty much World War one and World War II so once these nations develop their infrastructures and develop people's sense of belonging to a nation it very easily it becomes very easy to slip into a kind of chauvinism where your nation is better you're trying to make your nation better than the next Nation and this sort of leads to it also how do I put this best basically I could say that overly identifying with people from your nation makes you hostile to other nations and World War one is actually started by this very very very silly kind of incident where a Serbian terrorist who wants Bosnia to become part of Serbia goes and assassinates the heir to the throne of Austria because Austria governs Bosnia and so the serbs want to take Bosnia over this happens again in the 90s but anyway the serbs want to take Bosnia over and they think they're going to achieve that by um fracturing the state of by fracturing the Habsburg Dynasty by fact fracturing the state of Austria-Hungary and they do that by assassinating the heir to the throne and here you see the last photograph of the heir to the Austrian thrown alive uh this is he's leaving the town hall of Sarajevo and Bosnia and he's Associated by gabrillo princip a member of this terrorist organization called the black hand and at first nobody thought that this would cause a war but it started pulling in alliances where Austria-Hungary said okay uh it was a Serbian terrorist who assassinated our heir to the throne so we're going to impose all these unreasonable demands on Serbia uh we're gonna say okay we're gonna come in we're gonna do the investigation of who you know who's behind this man who killed our heir to the throne our like future leader and we're gonna basically take over the state sovereignty um temporarily to solve this we're kind of gonna do it was like there the austria-hungries 911. and um that pulled in austria-hungary's um Ally official Ally Germany and Serbia meanwhile Serbia was defended by its traditional Ally Russia and then Russia was Allied with France and then France was alive in Britain so suddenly this tiny local conflict in this small town in the middle of nowhere becomes a cause where all these major nations are Allied against each other and out of a sense of National Honor they feel a need to buttress their to like um stand behind their allies and this kind of very like primitive street fighting way um and you suddenly get a huge conflagration that leaves tens of millions of people dead just out of this exaggerated artificially created sense of National Honor and one last thing um what's really sort of interesting is that in the decades leading up to World War One the local ruling classes um I mean the ruling classes of these nation states of these National Estates deliberately encourage the media the newspapers and remember like now more and more people are reading because of primary school education established by these countries they're deliberately um funding the media and telling the media to put stories about how um if you're in Germany how Germany is great and how France is always trying to conspire against Germany or if you're in Serbia how Serbia is great and Austria is always trying to conspire against you if you're in Russia how Russia is great and Fri and Germany's trying to conspire against you and they're trying to create a sense of national solidarity through hatred of the other and the reason they're trying to do this to bring it back to Professor Dennis's earlier lectures on Marxism is they're deliberately trying to do this because they are afraid of the working classes in their countries that are the most oppressed classes still in spite of things like Universal education they still don't have they don't have unions they don't have uh labor laws they don't have any of the things that protect workers today um they are still the most depressed classes and they have found in socialism an ideology that is about the transnational supernational Brotherhood of all working people across state lines and Marx and his followers and the people that took over socialism the Socialist organizations of every state proclaim the Fraternal Unity of all peoples and they said we must have socialist Revolution against the upper classes everywhere and we must ignore nationalism because nationalism is just a tool of the ruling upper classes of the bourgeoisie to keep us in our place and keep us separated and subsequently if you look if when you know the archives of these states were opened up and you saw the official Communications between various members of governments and rulers and diplomats you see these official Communications they are writing to each other and especially in Russia Russia is on the verge of social Revolution the king says to his prime minister you know what and the Prime Minister agrees with him you know what we're on the verge of having a revolution from below and the best way that we can get Russians to come together is to fight a war so this is a deliberate strategy on the part of um people that are particularly afraid uh members of the bourgeoisie and the upper classes who are particularly afraid of the lower classes coming together across National divisions so they literally uh inflame the public they inflame the public with false news stories of how you know people from other the other countries are trying to destroy them when you know it's it's just not the case so that when everyone goes to war people support it because they've been conditioned by 20 years of education and media to support it and what's crazy is that everybody went into World War One thinking that it would be just a short war that it would last three months because previous wars in the 19th century had been short that it would just last three months and that it would be a way for the bourgeoisie and the rulers of each country to solidify their leadership of that country and instead of course this is the final point War has its own logic events take over from ideology they think it's going to be three months but it ends up lasting five I'm sorry four and a half years and destroying all of the monarchies that went into it to try to prop themselves up and literally it's it's mind-boggling to me that you read people in 19 you read like The rulers you read documents from Prime Ministers foreign ministers in July and August 1914 and they're like oh we're gonna have a war but it's gonna be like fine it's gonna bring the nation together and anyway everyone will be home if we start this war in August everyone will be quote home in time to watch the leaves fall like they thought it would be done by October November and then it just once you had states fighting each other that had these immense resources of people and of um industrialized Weaponry it didn't stop until everyone was completely exhausted until all the men that kind of military age that were there pretty much like they just run out of people so it was this huge enormous disaster uh known at the time as the Great War and that is what led to the first it was everyone's horror at what had happened in World War one that led to the establishment of the first League of Nations the antecedent to the United Nations that tried to say okay let's establish a forum of international cooperation where leaders and representations of nation states can come together and iron out their differences um in a peaceful way because we can't afford to have this happen again but of course it did happen again in World War II partially because the individual Nations didn't the upper classes didn't really take responsibility for how they had fomented the war so they went into the Treaty of Versailles the Peace of Versailles that ended World War One in 1919 kind of still blaming each other still carrying over those grievances so that the French didn't feel ah okay we won you know Germany invaded us but we won like let's all live in peace now instead they thought oh my god let's put a huge Indemnity on the German economy and impoverish them for a generation um because we freaking hate them so much because they destroyed our lives so the bitterness of lived experience takes over and they impose this very very heavy in Indemnity on Germany and that leads to a huge resentment in Germany that eventually leads to the rise of German nationalism and the rise of Adolf Hitler then you have World War II which makes World War One look like a party in that World War II becomes a real Total War that also involves an air war and for the first time involves the mass bombings of civilians World War One pretty much only soldiers were dying because and maybe like the peasants in the way of the actual armies because you didn't have aerial Warfare yet you didn't have bombs but by World War II it becomes a war that completely does not distinguish between uh Soldier and civilian that just kills everybody and it is the total Destruction of World War II uh with some 70 million dead that leads to the creation of the United Nations as kind of a stronger newer better version of the League of Nations so you have the League of Nations after World War One it doesn't really work isn't really effective doesn't really have complete buy-in after World War one and then you have a newer updated League of Nations called the United Nations established in San Francisco after World War II I think it was officially ratified in 1948 and that finishes nationalism and I'm sorry it was so cursory but there was so much to get through I hope that I've gotten across some of the points of the good and bad sides of nationalism and how nationalism drove 20th century history and led to this determination on the part of the major States the major powers of the world to not have it happen again by the way in talking about World War II just because there's no time I am literally skipping over enormous things that I feel terrible about skipping over I'm skipping over the fact that after World War One The Victors in World War one divided the Ottoman Empire and created these arbitrary somewhat arbitrary divisions in much of the Middle East like there was no particular reason that Iraq should be this way in this shape um or that Syria should be in that shape except that the British wanted it that way but um and that led that has led to that that ridiculous sort of settlement where the the victors of World War One in the west carve up the Middle East leads to some of the problems that we lived through in the 90s and 2000s so I kind of just want to say it's really really fitting to me that President Biden declared the end of the war in Afghanistan after 20 years because it's sort of that was kind of the most recent crazy burst of nationalism that we've had in this country where we blamed a whole country for what a bunch of terrorists did on 9 11. the way that World War One happened out of one terrorist event in Sarajevo in 1914 and that's my ending thank you so much

Lecture 14	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JBinnEayVY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

record so this lecture and the next lecture we're going to talk about the erosion of the nation's state power due to things that come out of globalization and you have already learned about nation state sovereignty the idea of legitimacy the concept of citizenship and so this lecture is going to talk about the first three challenges to the nation-state as a supremely powerful and independent actor and the lecture following is going to follow up on the last two challenges that come out of globalization the nation continues to be a key unit of order and organization in the world According to hobbsbomb which is one of the readings that is associated with this lecture um there are centralizing and unitary implications of the term Nation as opposed to synonyms like the public or the community or the union these are synonyms but they don't exactly mean the same thing and we have learned in previous lectures uh what all of it is encompressed by the idea of the nation um and the nation is still really important as a both a an idea of legitimacy and the basis for creating an identity so for example populist parties use imagined National communities to gain power um even though hyper globalists will say that National borders are no longer relevant today uh many theorists decry the decline of the nation-state's power they're still going to refer to the nation-state as a unit of organization since 1945 the number of nations a number of states in the world has increased as a 130 former colonies became independent or joined existing countries you know at the same time as there have been an increase in the number of countries the number of nation states there's been a decline in any other kind of government unit in the world system the decline of colonies a decline of territories you know there are no longer any un trust territories everything has moved over to a nation-state so therefore the idea of a nation state still is very relevant and important today so in recent memory like 1991 many of you were born around then at Uzbekistan Turkmenistan Kazakhstan they all became newly independent countries um East Timor became a Sovereign Nation as recently as 2002. in 2011 the Palestinian president Muhammad Abbas Mahmoud Abbas excuse me he formerly petitioned the UN for Statehood recognition and this move was vetoed by the United States but just the fact that he did that um and actually a lot of countries recognize Palestine tells us how important this concept is you know there are other kinds of um non-nation-state units that exist in the world system that are autonomous regions there are independent self-governing states that are part of a Nation think about Puerto Rico Puerto Rico is a common wealth a part of the American Commonwealth or the Marshall Islands so also that but the associated state of Micronesia Commonwealth but we really don't see a lot of these things we really see countries um in your readings jurgensmeyer says the nation-state is still quote the primary community of reference and quote nation states as the only building blocks of World Order end quote so still really important so today's lecture we're going to talk about the first three challenges to the concept of the nation state as independent and supremely Powerful actor um one challenge of the nation's sovereignty comes from the global movement of non-citizens non-citizen migrants often that move for economic reasons or political reasons or for safety reasons the fleeing of fashion the fleeing uh legitimate Festival lives um this causes a problem for the idea of the nation state because it raises the question of where is the source of legitimacy of government over the governed when some significant proportion of the residence of a territory are not for citizens um were they potentially organized around other nations State non-nation-state affiliations does this increase tensions and pluralistic multi-ethnic States uh can it degrade the basis upon which the nation state sovereignty raps so we're going to talk about that today the Second Challenge we're going to talk about today is from the growth of regional and international Global governance organizations such as the United Nations or the European Union there are many different intergovernmental organizations that have developed to solve transnational Collective action problems so for example the need for coordination of technology has led to International standards uh that almost every national government agrees to follow the Unicode standard that I aced standard we can go on and on intergovernmental organizations are Supra National Supra s u p r a that means above greater than and National means National so there are these organizations that are greater than a nation state um and they are institutions organizations to which nations give away certain authorities and certain powers and by giving away this these Powers they're obviously giving away certain giving certain abilities for something besides themselves to impinge on their internal and their external Affairs so they're giving away some degree sovereignty in some rounds the European Union the World Bank the United Nations the international monetary fund the World Trade Organization they all provide processes and rules they can punish and they can sanction and they can enforce rules against nation states usually by expelli nation states for membership um and so you might ask why why would a country give up it's ultimate Supreme sovereignty well the benefits that come from coordinating and cooperating with other Nation States can be greater than the benefits of just doing being able to do what you want um and so together uh so that this is why countries give up their the certain rights uh and authorities because they're going to actually benefit more at the end of the day um if we talk about global governance and we'll Define governance also in this lecture we're talking about countries interacting in an International System but we're also talking about intergovernmental organizations actually we'll also talk about non-governmental organizations that we'll get to uh in the next lecture not this lecture another challenge of nation-state sovereignty third one arises from the growth of global economic networks that take away power of national governments which is that monetary and economic policy so related to this is the idea that certain actors in the world such as a very large International corporations I think Coca-Cola for example um they're not always accountable to a nation-state right because it's so big they're working in multiple nation states and they can threaten to to leave or move their headquarters uh move the manufacturing away and so they can gain leverage and they're not necessarily fully accountable so those are the three challenges to the power and the authority and the sovereignty of nation states that come from globalization next week the next lecture we're going to talk about the erosion of nation-state sovereignty by World culture and World Society and also the version of nation state sovereignty by international non-governmental organizations so I want to begin by just reviewing sovereignty again so we understand what is being threatened by these challenges that come from globalization so just to review the last couple lectures and nation state is synonymous with a collective people and as harvestbomb says the modern concept of the nation began to be used in political and social discourse starting in about 1830. it equates a people with a state in a nation-state Citizens abroad by institutions that govern on their own behalf even if the government is a monarch or a dictator he or she is going to claim to represent the people and this concept contrasts with the idea of people within a bounded territory being the subject of a government you know like the subject of a principality or the subject of a colonial power uh or you know being the subject of to someone else rather the government whatever form it takes works for the citizens sovereignty is the idea that within the territorial boundaries of a state the ruling Authority organs have complete authority to act as they so please so what we've been covering again sovereignty is supreme authority within a territory and this idea that every nation state agrees to creates when they agree to it creates International order it create it contributes to creating an international order there is a hindrance to Anarchy and to constant Warfare it's one of the reasons that the West feels so threatened by Russian uh aggression an invasion of Ukraine it goes against this basic idea establishing 1648 piece of Westphalia a a a government has uh Authority within its the boundaries of the nation-state and other countries are not going to do not have a legitimate right to not recognize those borders so political life it is something that is organized through the political unit of the nation state and each state respects the territoriality of others and therefore is respected by them so many I mentioned the 130 colonies and territories became independent nations in the 20th century and many of those new nation states were really too weak to defend themselves by themselves the military is weren't that strong but nevertheless they were not captured by strong Nations for the most part because this concept of sovereignty uh was generally agreed upon by by every nation state and the sovereign state is really considered the most legitimate way to fend off just Anarchy in in a world it's the foundation of the International System so for example the United Nations Charter the established United Nations the states quote nothing shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state for article 2-4 of the charter says it prohibits attacks by the United Nations on quote the political Independence and territorial Integrity of Nations it prohibits and restricts intervention by the UN into Sovereign Nations Affairs in other words unless they're invited in by the country they cannot and should not send in the troops have peacekeeping trips so I want to review the definition of a Nation before I continue on you could also put that in your head um and let's start by talking about this political philosopher many of you have probably heard of named John Stuart Mills and in 1861 he wrote The Following quote a portion of mankind may be said to constitute a nationality if they are united among themselves by Common sympathies which do not exist between them and any others which make them cooperate with each other more willingly than with other people desire to be under the same government and desire that it should be government by themselves or a portion of themselves exclusively this feeling of nationality may have been generated by various causes this is what John Stuart Mill wrote in this chapter on nationality as connected to representative government to get in our heads but again what it means to be a a nationality because I really want to get to this next point of talking about a polity a political polity an apology is a collective of individuals having a single set of interests the boundaries of a policy will traditionally defined by territorial boundaries this is the Stafford encyclopedia philosophies definition on sovereignty according to a French philosopher Bodin in 1576 he wrote this definition which is helpful to understand what apology is quote a polity is the political Society comprising both the ruler and ruled rulers and ruled were integrated into a single unitary body politic that was above any other human law and it is the source of human law end quote so apology establishes necessary unrestricted ruling power and this power it establishes is legal and it can't disregard existing lies or regulations but it is also uh the polity is above all law and regulation in the sense that it creates and generates human law the laws that nation states uh uh that establish nation states and help nation states uh you know run right so the most important thing to remember is that a polity is the a unitary body with boat that has two parts that come together the ruler and the road and the polity gives legitimacy to the ruling authority to exercise Sovereign Authority so in the excerpt that if any readings associated with this lecture hobbsbomb says uh that a nation so considered was the body of citizens whose Collective sovereignty constituted them a state which was their political expression the state is a political unit um and an expression of the sovereignty that uh citizens of a Nation uh have and the purpose of the supreme authority held by a single entity is to promote the interests of the polity even totalitarian rulers the Kim Jong-un they meet this definition in the sense that the North Korean ruler is ruling over a territorially defined Community boundaries in North Korea in what he believes to be the interests of his subjects and a state is linked to a territory and a nation is linked to a polity so we get nation state that combines the characteristics of apology giving legitimacy and sovereignty Supremacy Authority right over a specific territory and this brings us to a conundrum a problem sovereignty is vested in nation states nation states are constructed based on the idea of a common community so that's the legitimacy of a nation-state sovereignty is constructed it's vulnerable to questioning when the idea of the common Community is no longer broadly shared so in broader areas where populations have more than one concept of a national community um there are often these are often areas where there are conflicts are more likely but World conflicts are persistent think about the skirmishes in the Kashmir region the commercials between Pakistan and India uh since not ever since 1972 over the location of the actual border or the Russian invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014 you know half of the population at that time in that part of Ukraine they identified as Russian um or think about in 2020 more recently the negoro paraba war between ethnic Armenians who lived in the azerbaijani Republic of Arkansas um excuse me so these are Armenians Armenia has its own nation state but ethnic Armenians that lived in an autonomous region of Azerbaijan which is right next door in democratic nations the participation of the road in choosing the rulers generates a body politic and some policy some polities are defined by ethnic nationalism other policies are defined by Civic nationalism because we learned last week so citizenship determines which individuals within the territory boundaries um and therefore uh which ones are allowed to participate in the body politic um so everybody living within a territory are subject to a government but only citizens are allowed to participate in the political unit of the nation-state in the body politic so this raises this question of what happens as the definition of citizenship changes so the definition of citizenship can change due to internal politics uh it can change due to uh migratory patterns and this can result in there being a significant minority of the population that is not except um and the question is does this change the locus of where sovereignty is vested and therefore the perceived legitimacy of any nation-state actions both internal actions and external actions so one challenge to nation state sovereignty comes from immigration globalization and tastes large number of individuals to participate in a global labor market in this in the reading for this lecture Danny Habib argues that embodied globalization remember the movement of people has created large classes of non-citizen residents and foreigners which create gen create a challenge to the idea of a nation-state that is ruled by its policy temporary residents and not citizens by definition cannot participate in political life with many temporary residents and the national population might no longer equal the Democratic polity that is self-governing so for example why do you think for a second and guess in your own heads what percent of the United Arab Emirates residents are citizens the United Arab Emirates is a small nation state on the uh Arab Gulf Coast so how nation states enforce immigration is also hindered or impacted by uh things outside of the nation-state so many most countries have signed some International treaties um related to immigration or how they treat immigrants or how they treat certain kinds of immigrants like Asylum Seekers um and if you have signed a treaty an international treaty what does that mean it means you're specifically giving up certain authorities and powers to something greater than you or to some agreement um so uh any UN member that has signed treaties on uh refugees you know they're not allowed if you signed it you're not allowed to turn away Asylum Seekers um or if they signed any of the human rights uh treaties they're not they can only do certain things that to protect their borders you can't do things that go against the human rights of people because you've signed a treaty saying you uphold them for example you can't shoot unarmed people who are trying to cross into your border uh you know for whatever reason they're trying to cross into your border you or you can't even treat individuals in your own country in ways that contravene human rights law another challenge um to nation-state sovereignty it's part of this first General Challenge from immigration citizenship comes from how globalization forces can divide the polity in a nation state if the nation-state has many different ethnicities if it is a multi-ethnic nation-state and there are many multi-ethnic nation-states though that have minority population in what and some of these the minority populations in practice in actuality are not given equal rights the the systematically discriminate against or they're not recognized you know in it certainly in American history uh you know African Americans were discriminated against uh some people argue that uh structurally American law and Regulatory regime still discriminate against uh minorities other people say that's not true uh if you just go to another country go to Eastern European countries uh many of them discriminate against the Roma peoples um you can think about Myanmar Burma the Bohemia or a ethnic group that were driven out um you know genocide you know the the army of Burma committed genocide and and pushed out and there are I want to say hundreds of thousands of um someone correct me if I'm wrong uh refugees rohingya refugees and U.N camps in uh in Bangladesh on the border now um um or you think about how China uh discriminates Against The Nepalese uh or against the uyghur ethnic groups within China so um there are many examples of multi-ethnic nation states where there are ethnic groups that are treated as second class citizens um and what happens when that happens well the discriminated groups might choose to organize they might not feel like the part of the nation as much as um they feel that the part of their ethnicity so they might organize around their ethnicity and so some of the ethnic-based conflicts over the past three decades have Arisen out of minority ethnic groups being systematically discriminated against in government presence in Economic Opportunity opportunity in Social Status uh so for example this is one of the contributing factors to the war that just I don't know if it just ended or if there's just kind of a temporary uh ceasefire and temporary peace but in Ethiopia uh there was a war between the state of Ethiopia and the Ethiopian military and the tigray ethnic group that controlled the northern in Northern autonomous region in in the country or think about that Tutsi and the Hutu in Rwanda you've all heard of them the Tutsi were traditionally harders and they had greater wealth and higher Social Status just simply because of the legacy of the Belgian Colonial rule and the Hutu were economically discriminate against and socially discriminated against even though they were the majority people they were discriminated against and so many decades of this structurally exacerbated conflict eventually blew up into the the this Rwanda genocide we all know about um whether putu militias uh tried to exterminate uh the Tutsi until the Tutsi eventually began control globalization and new communication platforms they that facilitate things that we think of as positive discussion the creation identity across you know Geographic space that facilitate organization organizing that can contribute to the idea of a worldwide ethnic Community Um this can also perhaps challenge a sense of shared identity inside the boundaries of a nation-state the more extensive and intensive relationships that develop fund globalization this was mentioned by your Arthur stagger in chapter one of your textbook this could have in the right environment have negative impacts impact negative impacts on the cohesion that's created by a sense of shared Civic brother and Sisterhood you know especially if shared historical ties start to fray if shared identities start to fray um in nation states that are multi-ethnic collectives um and you can use it doesn't even mean that a multi-ethnic nation state is going to have ethnic tensions India for example from for most of its history is an independent nation did not have ethnic uh Strife um and in its Constitution it it always Prides itself on being multi-ethnic it actually spent a lot of money just to enforce the idea of itself as a multi-ethnic country um and it wasn't until recently with Modi and the rise of the BJ uh peat party that focused on Hindu nationalism that you start to see this ethnic and religious separatism well you're thinking about the fights between the Sunni and the Shia in a nation state like Iraq or Afghanistan um you know these are different ethnicities existed always did but they did not create tension in the way they did after the government was you know pushed out because of the U.S you know Invasion um and and then the power vacuum led to fights um for power and people organized around these ethnic or religious in this case Tunisia religious differences um and and that kind of caused uh tension in in the idea of a United single polity of the ruler and the world as one United thing so in multi-ethnic nation states even those with very strong Cosmopolitan identities where awareness of universal human rights um uh exist political movements can arise that Define a nation-state by a single ethnicity or a single race or a single religion and then use that as a pretext for a certain sovereignty and this can threaten internal peace so consider what's occurred under Modi is leadership in India where Muslims in Kashmir and throughout the country are systematically discriminated against and left unprotected by the legal enforcement structures of the police and the military Kashmir has been you know cut off and shut down a free movement has been hindered for years now under this pretext of uh security but really it is Muslims because that's who lives in Kashmir who are being affected not uh Hindu people or other uh ethnicities um as ethnic groups in Malta ethnic States lose their representation or their ability to be represented and no longer become recognized in the polity as a result of State policies as a result of voted repression I was as a result of discrimination then what can happen they can potentially organize around ethnic nationalism as a principle as the principle the only way that they feel they have left to engage with their investors it's why we see uh you know what is happening in uh with uh Sikhs um in forgetting which part of India are now organizing um asking for I don't know if it's autonomy or Independence because they don't feel that they can be represented uh correct you know correctly or in in in Indian national politics so that's just one example but there are many so now I want to talk about the Second Challenge to nation-state sovereignty and that's from globalization influence uh through intergovernmental organizations Igo these are Supra National governments to which nations give away certain authorities uh which impinge upon uh the country's internal and external affairs one nation's one aspect why does it the question is why do they do this one nation states can communicate and together create binding rules uh enforce these rules and then start to solve uh Global problems like global warming or terrorism or overfishing overseas or the need for Global Technology standards or any other Collective action problems then they they benefit so International governance organizations are a tool to do that igos establish processes and rules that members must follow and igos can punish they can sanction the human Force these rules against nation states usually this punishment is by you know expelling a nation-state from the benefits of the organization for membership in the organization right again like share nation states Act only in their own citizens interests it's a good question and the answer is always yes but by cooperating by giving up power they are doing that um they uh individual rational actors and they realize that they can benefit more if they follow the rules and ensure that everybody else follows those same rules than if everybody if they just did what they wanted um and under certain conditions cooperation is more beneficial to a nation uh than not cooperating um even if the problem occurs physically outside of the territorial boundaries of an ocean state so the consequence is that in practice nation-state sovereignty is impacted even if in theory nation-states return you know retain keep absolute Authority within their territory so if we talk about a global governance Network we're talking not just about nation states but we're talking about nation states plus intergovernmental organizations igos um and this creates a complex network of global governance many of you are familiar with the United Nations is actually located just down the road on the east side of uh the the Manhattan I think in the like uh 50s um and so I'm going to use the UN as a case to explore how intergovernmental organizations exert influence on nation-states uh but before I do that I want to introduce the concept of governance as you know I'm contrasting governance with government so let's talk about governance according to Mark bevere governance refers to all processes of governing rather undertaken by a government Market or network whether over a family tribe formal or informal organization or territory and whether through laws or norms power or language so the idea of governance embodies a lot of different things essentially it's this idea that you an individual you adjust your behavior not just with regards to a government law but also with respect to policies that are determined by other entities or other actors even norms established by your group of society that you hang out with Norms are not written down so many of you watching this video um probably live in an apartment and in your apartment I bet that people probably don't play music at 2 A.M in the morning it's true that the New York Department of Environmental Protection has roles about noise pollution but that's probably not why people don't play music late more likely your apartment building has a policy of a quiet period after 10 pm maybe you live in a neighborhood that's very tight-knit and you know that your neighbors will complain and you'll get a bad reputation if you play music that keeps other people up and awake um so maybe it's there's a norm in the neighborhood a norm which is a rule that's not formal but is enforced through you know social approbation um nevertheless so an individual's Behavior a choice to behave in a certain way is affected by laws or Norms that are made and enforced by multiple entities like apartment buildings like the community like the city of New York or the state of New York or the federal government so this idea is governance is that governance encompasses all the processes that contribute to defining permissible actions and granting power and so the nation states no different than the individual in our analogy International governance refers to the network of interrelated power centers that include provincial authorities Regional blocks International organizations International governance is not just nation states it's also intergovernmental organizations like the Yuan but also non-governmental organizations like Greenpeace or even just specialized networks for sharing information so males around the world for example have their own International Network it's called the world Association of major metropolises um so the point is just that there are many power centers that contribute to governance in a world and in our lives so the UN is a a good example and of intergovernmental organization and since it is so important um in a world system I want to talk about it and introduce it a little bit more in more detail the un's mission articulated in its Charter are to maintain International Peace and security to protect human rights to deliver humanitarian Aid to promote sustainable development and to uphold international law and a couple more have been added recently building a more sustainable world and Collective action to slow climate change that's its purpose neon was founded in 1945 but it's important to know that it was not founded as a quote gentle idealistic vision this is according to uh Stephen Schlesinger Schlesinger says the U.N was founded to and facilitate diplomacy that's the purpose and there are six main organs of the United Nations first is the general assembly this is the main deliberative policy baking organ of the U.N all the different member states of the UN are represented in the general assembly and what do they do they make recommendations you make recommendations to the security Council they write reports they approve United Nations budgets and these recommendations that they write up are called resolutions un resolutions a United Nations General Assembly resolution is a decision or a declaration that gets voted on by all member states of the United Nations in the general assembly now these resolutions are non-binding um they are not nation states do not have to um agree to them or follow them um they cannot be enforced unless they get adopted by number three here the security Council let me give you two examples of resolutions resolution 194 was adopted in 1948. this resolution resolved quote refugees wishing to return to the homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest possible date and also compensation should be paid for um if these people choose not to return um but have left property that property needs to be paid for that's one example of a resolution well think about resolution 69 292 this resolution was adopted recently in 2015. it crafted an international law for the conservation um and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in those parts of the world that are not under a nation states jurisdiction so if you go from a coastline out a certain number of miles or kilometers um the area no longer is in National Waters but others International seats and in those areas um this resolution uh applies right because this resolution is adopted um resolutions get adopted by the security Council right um they I mean they become binded only by the security Council the security Council number three um votes whether they're going to adopt them or not so talk about that in a minute but let me talk about number two is it which is a Secretariat the Secretariat carries out the day-to-day operation of the United Nations so when you hear about the U.N Secretary General um who is that is in the Secretariat and he currently he uh is the head of the UN General Assembly this is now Antonio guterres the third organ of the United Nations is the 15-member security Council they decide on what constitutes a Potential Threat to security um and peace in the world and they vote on those General Assembly resolutions and if they vote positively those General Assembly resolutions become binding um so it's a security Council that can impose U.N sanctions they can authorize U.N intervention to send troops to an active war zone um and the security Council has 15 members but five of them are permanent while 10 of them rotate the five permanent members also have veto power meaning that they can say no any one of them can say no to a resolution and it does not pass the fourth organ is the ecosock The Economic Security Council and they are quote the principal body for coordination policy review policy dialogue recommendations on economic social environmental issues and information of internationally agreed development goals according to the United UN website ecosolk has 15 specialized agencies and commissions and programs and expert bodies uh these are relative each one of these is relatively autonomous and they work within the UN system meaning that they report their activities to the ecosol council but they're mostly left to their own devices so for example the undp develops sustainable development goals which many of you have heard about and they focused on poverty reduction HIV AIDS environmental energy Etc or the UN High Commissioner for refugees they're no they're also known as the U.N Refugee agency they're the ones when you say the U.N set such refugee camps to help displace persons and provide safe environments that's what the U.N High Commission for refugees tests so I'm going to skip the trustee ship Council because they suspended operation 28 years ago so 29 years ago and the last organ of the UN is the international court of justice they're the principal judicial organ of the UN so there are four different ways that the UN influences nation states and this is an example of how intergovernmental organizations influence the nation states so first they can provide a forum for negotiating disputes Nations can submit any claims that they have to a higher authority one that is above the nation-state and the U.N arbitrates disputes administrators administrates Justice through the international court of justice this was established in 1948. it's also known as The Hague you may have heard that and it's tried 178 cases through November of 2019. only countries can bring a dispute to the hay to the international court of justice so for example um they were on Boundary distributes um there was a dispute between Tunisia and Libya um what there was a U.S complaint against Iran about the detainment of diplomats those all went to the international court of justice um they also have a international criminal court this is a permanent international criminal court to quote bring to Justice the perpetrators of the worst crimes known to human kind war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide One National courts don't act the second um way that uh the U.N influences nation states takes away some of their sovereignty is by creating International Norms that limit activities within nation states uh activities which could create conditions for war so this is done by the U.N voting and passing resolutions for example in 1948 the general assembly adopted the universal Declaration of Human Rights to respect over 30 separate human rights for individuals so this document proclaims basic civil political economic rights are common to all humans um and even though this declaration is not legally binding it was passed in the general assembly but not um in the security Council nevertheless became the basis for two treaties and these treaties are binding to everybody that signed them so that's the 1966 International Convent and civil and political rights um and um uh and another treaty that kind of follows up on so um the UN also has the ability to report and investigate human rights abuses um it can only take action by Security Council resolution but it can still investigate um human rights uh allegations without a um a message without the security Council passing the degree into it the other process by which the United Nations just generally creates norms um is because they originate International treaties International treaties that then get ratified by Nations meaning what does it mean to ratify it means that the signatory countries indicate their consent to be bound by the treaty this is also called a compact if you hear the Tron International compact that's an international treaty so and another example would be the conservation of biological diversity this was signed in 1992 um and 190 countries signed on to it to promote the conservation of protection and Equitable sharing of the world's genetic resources biodiversity third the UN creates conditions for Global cooperation it's another way that they influence nation states simply they create Avenues um and and uh bring together uh experts to help us understand is a world difficult problems that we face and then hopefully take coordinated action so climate change is a is a good example of this right um the UN has many specialized agencies through which this particular kind of work is accomplished and many of these agencies are ones that fall under the Eco economic and social uh Oregon of the U.N the last way that the U.N influences nation states uh and why they're losing International sovereignty is that they don't necessarily control the exercise of violence right remember I said nation states uh controlled uh had a monopoly in violence but there's such a thing as a U.N peacekeeping for us the purpose of the peacekeeping force is to help maintain order and protection and the goal of the UN and and sending the peacekeeping voice is to prevent nation-states from losing this Monopoly on the use of force to coerce and control inhabitants right um so the UN has peacekeeping operations in had them in Afghanistan at one point in Central African Republic had them in Iraq Syria Lebanon Sudan parts of Mexico uh currently as of at least a couple years ago they were in Jammu and Kashmir on the Pakistan India border and the Central African Republic in the western Sahara Mali golden height Cyprus Kosovo South and South Sudan the U.N has 7 000 uniform military personnel and 20 000 Personnel just giving you guys a sense of how uh much the the blue helmets as they're sometimes called uh uh are helpful in the world peace is a public good um and when states are not um controlled with the Monopoly and power they produce terrorism think about the terrorism that we see in parts of northern Mexico right um they also when States fall apart like Syria they produce refugees and other kinds of bad things that are very costly to all the nation states in the world so that's even though coordinating a in international response to maintain peace has costs it's often in the self-interest of Nations to participate in this global system of peacekeeping and you know the reason that they are taken away from International sovereignty is really uh something that's occurred since 1990 because until 1990 the UN always required the approval of the countries that they were going into and sending the peacekeeping forces into um under this U.N principle of non-intervention however uh the first Iraq war in 1990 was the first time the U.S the U.N went against this concept of westphalian sovereignty um and uh you know they agreed to send in military operations to protect uh uh thinking on the name um to protect the neighborhood that Iraq had invaded right um um and this was the first time um it's happened but then after 1990 we see like former Yugoslavia Bosnia Kosovo Somalia Rwanda Haiti um Cambodia Iberia Libya the U.N started to one a security Council passed a resolution and in the peacekeeping troops even though they weren't invited by the the government empowerment in other words in certain conditions the failed States um the world Community gives permission to ignore State sovereignty this is since 1990. Challenge number three uh of how globalization is challenged in the sovereign state comes from the growth of global economic networks so Challenge number three the growth of global economic networks these networks take power away from National governments um and they do that because you know not um National governments don't no longer have a lot of power even when they set monetary policy even when they set Economic Policy uh National economies is so intertwined in uh global trade and even just Global trends of what's Happening that the national policies don't really have a lot of power they don't really do a lot um so there are um important ways that um political Arrangements um can affect uh uh networks of governance um and self-determination and even the accountability that a government has to its citizens their politics so when there is a lot of coordination among nations at International levels or intergovernmental organizations that Nations belong to that constrain what a country is then therefore allowed to do with economic policy or any other policy Um this can um make the nation no longer really accountable to the people the people who should be able to kick you out if they don't like the policies that you enact um so this is one of the downsides of global governance and the problem with many many International organizations in intergovernmental organizations excuse me operating you know um and and you know just especially true with global economic governance so you have the international monetary fund or the World Bank but you learned about in previous lectures yes so in the Jurgen Meyer compilation reading that you read for this lecture um one of the scholars Oh my he argues that communities of Interest are no longer defined by State political boundaries but instead by economic linkages saying the territory boundaries of states uh becoming increasingly irrelevant and the political Trends and economic Trends are being driven by power of very large corporations transnational corporations that he says operate in a near-liberal capitalist system so in other words as the linkages the political linkages among states and begin to lose importance um there's a dominance of new channels of relations based on economic activity and so when states are relating to each other more about economic activity and then other entities involved like very large corporations um and so when things move from being politically accountable to just being economically accountable uh by that definition you're no longer really States or are no longer accountable to the polity but to the people but rather to the economic Trends economic pressures and economic Trends are and channels are often not related to traditional political boundaries so oh my his scholar of international studies takes this radical position quote nation states are not meaningful units of participation in the global economy of the borderless world end quote so in a similar vein there's another author you read associated with this lecture and that is Bowman Bauman in the reading he argued that the tools that the nation-state uses to manage its economies so battery balances books National policies it uses to influence unemployment and economic growth it just by fact no longer have very much of an impact because large transnational corporations operating in multiple countries have power and how do they they actually have economic power and they have economic power according to Bowman by lobbying governments and because it can Lobby different governments and pressure governments Bowman writes quote the levels of economic policy no longer work so we think about the nation-state what is it it's in in some ways it's a form where political action is feasible but then Bauman and omaya talking about these ungoverned transnational corporations that operate in economic channels um and they create channels to allocate resources and money there are related to economics but not to the political realm and the political realm is how the nation-state exerts controls so they're saying transnational businesses and transnational business forces operate outside of the nation-state and therefore outside of governance and lastly another uh posted mentioned in Reading Robinson goes even further he says that there is quote an emerging Network it doesn't quote have any centralized institutional forms it quote comprises of transformed and externally integrated National States together with Supra National Economic and political forums end quote by which he means that intergovernmental organizations the IMF the World Bank or trade organizations Regional Banks the G22 T20 countries right um Etc and so he says that these intergovernmental organizations kind of benefit transnational corporate um entities right yeah are not accountable to any nation-state policies so these uh you know he just says in general nation states being transcended by transnational forces uh institutions uh grounded in this global economic order um and the interstate system no longer of States interaction with each other with each accountable poetic features politics no longer really very powerful or working so those are the arguments for how the um that uh nation state sovereignty is is being eroded and powered by growth of global economic Networks

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in this lecture I'm going to talk about the last two challenges from globalization to the power the nation state and to the post was feeling International System of nation states interacting uh that kind of began to be eroded after World War II and the first challenge is farming international non-governmental organizations and the second the fifth challenge is from the emergence of global uh governance networks so I'm going to just review intergovernmental organizations like the UN so you don't confuse it with the fourth challenge which is international non-governmental organizations I ngos we can talk about framing a global issues by ngos and governance networks we talk about world society and World culture and then a case study of a global governance process the Kimberly process when Nations and other entities like transnational corporations or into international non-governmental organizations like Greenpeace or Amnesty International can create uh binding rules can communicate can enforce rules um they can solve problems like global warming terrorism um uh over I'm sorry guys I'm confusing you just ignore what I said ignore this whole slide um I'm really just repeating about intergovernmental organizations it's not being peace not honesty nothing like that okay I don't know what happened here in my notes um so International governmental organizations um like the World Bank un IMF um they can help nation states create binding rules and create um agreements and practices so that they can all follow this same um give up the same things and benefit from the cooperation that ensues right um and intergovernmental organizations are important part of this complex to Global governance along with nation states but there's a another two different elements a part of this Global governance one is intergovernmental organizations and then you know we can also think about transnet very very large transnational corporations uh that that operate around the world that are influenced by whatever rules um or norms the igos and ingos come up with so non-governmental organizations are voluntary associations and individuals groups or corporations who ban together to pursue specific goals and activities upon a worldwide or original basis that's a definition from electorality so many of you may have heard of the term Civil Society this refers to a community of citizens I think by common interests and from that connectivity international non-governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations are the units of Civil Society you know to atoms in a molecule I ngos and ingos form a global Civil Society so International ngos what makes a difference with ngos is that they if it's International means they operate in multiple countries in global operations as opposed to operating domestic and they're also part of this Global governance now right the network that broadly influences the choices of non-state entities like transnational corporations or like Coca-Cola or nation states um and anything in between right international non-governmental organizations they promote particular issues and they generate social movements ingos and ngos are self-authorized to Global bodies I'll talk about that a little bit later they they also have a diversity of goals and purposes um you know it could be promoting science or ideas of Human Rights or engineering or Sports hobbies and Medical Specialties you know for example the World Chess Federation or the international Union appear and applied to physics it's all international non-governmental organizations in your reading connected to this week's lecture bully and Thomas estimated that there are 20 or 25 000 private not-for-profit organizations that had International focuses now they've engine size from a few dozen individuals membership to um being in in in countries with millions of members um you know many um so to give you a sense of another sense of scale Lewis in 2010 and Riddell in 2007 they estimated that there were more than 35 000 international non-governmental organizations um and the number of inter National non-governmental organizations keeps increasing um according to uh Bully's research um you know since initiation so in 1875 until 1973 which is when he was doing this measurement uh you saw that the numbers just pure numbers kept increasing um and but especially after World War II you know and here after World War II just boom um and through the 1960s 90 new international non-governmental organizations were founded every year three quarters of the 27 000 ingos that were active in 2005 were added since 1975 according to a different researcher named Charter so you have a constant development of new ones um and there's an interesting Trend here you see there were two different times when there was a decline of non-governmental organizations um and these were doing periods of Crisis so before both World Wars one and two you saw um all of a sudden that uh populations of Nations looking Inward and the Civil Society and what people were doing looking Inward and not uh doing and therefore you see um a drop in ingos and this also correlates with a lies of nationalism um there are some unique characteristics of international governmental organizations that make them different from non-governmental organizations um you know it's not just that ngos only operate domestically and ingos operate internationally but also um ingos are often viewed as being more objective and having lower operational costs um then and then ngos um just because of their experience and their signs um very importantly ingos um operate as members of global consortia global confederations global affiliations um so many developing countries um uh have many ngos have uh International ngos have ngos in developing countries but because the NGO is part of an international NGL so I think save the children Nigeria is part of save the children International which is an international Consortium they have more access to resources so another example would be Oxfam Canada Oxfam Canada it's an autonomous organization it's got its own governance structure but it's and the international branch I mean the National Advanced count is part of Oxfam International Confederation which has 16 other member organizations um and what that means is because it can use the affiliations and the resources and the knowledge and sometimes the fundraising um of other ngos in their Consortium they have an EXT more extensive programmatic reach um and they can do things that just an NGO can't you know so for instance save the children which works in 120 countries globally they've got there's a U.S save the children um and they raise money and then they can go and give those donations to save the children Nigeria for programs in Nigeria the other big difference is that usually international non-governmental organizations have larger budgets they're allow for them to have a specialized staff that has dedicated roles um across many kinds of operations so this means that the knowledge is just deeper the capacity to do a program is deeper they have better monitoring and evaluation um and small ngos National GEOS just can't match right other things that International ngos can do is that they have a greater scope in connecting with academics with research centers with the private sector um in the delivery and design of the programs that they they do so the largest International ngos are considered trustworthy sources and channels for the delivery by of Aid by even government Ministries because they have this proven track record so just think about like the Red Cross for example and the delivery of Aid that they provide in Ukraine or they're dry they're getting resources from all the national Red Cross um affiliations a friend of mine uh it works in the Italian Red Cross and a lot of the work is getting uh resources and money and donated Goods to uh you create to to the Red Cross in Ukraine and expertise so now I want to move on to talking about how exactly International non-governmental organizations erode the nation-state power and Summit so first let's just talk about how international non-governmental organizations operate in the strategies the operational strategies and you know what do they do they make Global rules they disseminate knowledge they establish codes of Ethics right they propagate technical standards or environmental standards uh you know all of those are norms they do not have a police force all that they can do is is get people together and get experts together and create uh rules or recommendations and you know create a moral kind of uh uh movement behind those documents they also create identities of world citizens um you know to pursue common interests by which they I mean they tell people their membership that you're not just a member of a NGO that is focused domestically it's focused on the country you are part of a world by being part of an international NGO you are part of a world community and our interests are global other thing is to remember that it's very important is that international non-governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations for that matter they remain independent of the nation states they are non-profits that get Revenue from their own membership they do not need Green Peace Amnesty International if they do not get money from governments they can do what they want because they can survive without and they do survive without any governmental money they are supported by the membership they agree with the ideas that they're promoting ingos because all that they can do is put out new ideas and get uh social movements and put out Norms um they need to partnership with nation states and with intergovernmental organizations like GEOS in order to actually um get change done to do something so if you look at the numbers the World Bank says that 21 of the projects that the World Bank did involved uh you know Civil Society non-governmental and international non-governmental organizations in 1990 and that number percent uh Partnerships has increased tremendously by 2009 it had increased up to 81 percent of all the projects the World Bank involved Civil Society organizations and as I kind of just said a pressure I ngos pressure National governments to develop and support the specific policies that are important to the membership of the Ingo so there are three ways that ah ingo's Road the sovereignty of the nation state these specific ones the first is that ingos are not accountable to the government they're not accountable to anyone except their membership they're not accountable to the people in the countries that they operate in they're not accountable to the policy they represent outside interests of the membership but they nevertheless influences what happens within a country's border um you know the the financial accountable to the membership um so this can create concerns action second is that ingos promote ideas from World culture where I ngos operate international non-governmental organizations the same and Orient organizations individuals other actors nation states in a number of different ways so in other words they take ideas from World culture um and they uh try and push them in that country by proposing legislation by proposing policies by proposing changes in uh in by proposing local domestic social movements they're taking ideas and and promoting ideas from abroad I ngos are the carriers of new ideology you know what are these new ideologies you know what for example Care International very big Ingo yeah goal the mission is quote share a common Vision to fight against worldwide poverty and to protect and enhance human dignity right so these missions aren't necessarily uh bad or evil the usually very good but nonetheless promoting democracy uh you know ing is promoting democracy not very that wouldn't be invited into Turkmenistan what uh into North Korea Susan strange who is one of the authors in the readings that you read that are associated with the snack show she writes that social movements which are things that ingos and Civil Society promote are often in conflict with established political systems with established National governments his ingos and ngos domestically for that matter they often promote Alternative forms of Economic Development or Alternatives forms of social organization or alternative kind of social rights you know think about lgbtq um plus uh advocacy in Russia for example you know it goes against what the Russians did that the policies and the social ideas promoted by the Russian state and the influence of world culture just to talk about what was meant by that and we want to refer to your reading this week by bullying he says that world culture has the ideologies that promoted by World culture have five characteristics voice is Universalist so I ngos promote the idea of universal goals and Universal purposes anyone can be act an active member or beneficiary right anybody can benefit from playing chess that is just you know the idea is promoted are not specific to a territory second characteristic is individualism humans or any association of individuals are in which individuals and members um um are are um units let me start again um humans are the most important units according to Global culture not intergovernmental organizations not Nations not tribes not Clans what is important is that individual um individuals are the key actor and so this idea that the individual is what's important and that universalists the universalism uh the idea from whatever idea promoted by an Ingo applies around the globe this undermines other kinds of collectives the family the clan or God forbid national identity so you can see how Global culture goes against a promotion uh national identity and therefore can take away some of the power of the Michigan State ignos promote the individual as a concept and they reinforce the idea of individual Humanity human rights as opposed to the importance of the nation the third terrorist characteristic is rational volunteeristic Authority ingos and civil society organized um um people uh and themselves not people they organize themselves um around um this idea that they're acting rationally um and uh voluntary so if we remember ingos do not have any police power they cannot coerce or demand that you follow their ideas um only nation states can do that the police and the Jewish um and ingos say power is not necessary for legitimacy bully writes quote Ingo authority authority of an Ingo it doesn't flow from any legal bureaucratic Authority ingos are not written in the power is not written into nation states constitutions rather ingos get their power from informal and from cultural legitimacy the idea that quote responsible individuals acting collectively through rational processes can determine cultural rules that are just and Equitable and efficient this is what bully means by self authorization and by voluntary authority volunturistic authority so the fourth quality uh uh characteristic of world culture um is rationalization the Reliance on science or expertise or you know knowledge professionalization in in how international non-governmental organizations operate in the kinds of interventions that they design and Implement they're using science they're using rational thoughts um thinking that if they apply this they're going to uh help out most effectively and help make the world a better place the fifth characteristic is the idea of world citizens this is just the idea that all people are endowed with certain basic rights and obligations to each other you know that essentially everybody no matter what nation you are part of you are also part of a citizenship of a world polity it's a very egalitarian idea and I ngos translate the diffuse Global identity and authority of world citizenship this idea do specific rights specific claims specific prescriptions for World Behavior end quote this concept implicitly contrasts and contradicts right ethnocentric nationalism what like capitalism that's in egalitarian finally I want to talk about the Third Way that ingos in low Nation say sovereignty and that's by creating a robust Global governance Network so dates are foreign ERS and ingos are kind of the spearhead introducing new ideas into state so States don't really nation states create social change really they're not the leaders it's international non-governmental organizations or non-governmental organizations domestically that are the ones introducing or coming up with new ideas and then and then they Advocate you know the government and governmental partners and whatever to make changes in legislation and in laws and Regulation and whatever so I one of the ways this works is that ingos and ngos they frame Global issues they identify a frame that resonates with a global community of donors that they get money from or resources from um uh and and they apply a certain trained to interpret events and activities and things that are going on this interpretation this Frame the way you emphasize certain details and ignore others helps is how you mobilize social action um so one of the ways that I ngos and um igos for that matter contribute to Global governments governance is by modifying the ways that Collective action problems are perceived by policy makers and by other actors involved in creating the problems in the first place um so climate change is a good issue right uh one of the ways that Civil Society globally has been able to push put change in governments uh policy is by saying you're not looking at uh climate change in the right way stop looking at it as an economic cost and start looking at it as um you know uh humanitarian issues what a it's something that's going to become a cost to migration as you have a bunch of crime people migrating climate refugees or whatever you know lots of different ways a different way of finding that is that event by introducing new ways of seeing problems social movements mobilize individuals they mobilize collectives they mobilize National governments to develop rules and institutions to successfully hopefully manage the problem I want to drive up with train means frame is a Time invented by famous sociologist Irvin Goffman you don't need to know the details of this but you may be interested um he designates a famous quote eschimata of interpretation that allows individuals to quote locate perceive identify uh and label experiences that occur to them it's a way to make sense and make meaning of occurrences that occur in life um you might apply a frame of academic achievements to explain why you care about whether you receive an A versus a b in this class someone else in in the class might apply a frame of learning for learning's sake right they might be more concerned about what they learn in their class not how well they do so as as Benford and snow the two sociologists right quote by rendering events or occurrences meaningful frames function to organize experience and guide action whether that is individual or Collective action um and so there are four processes proposed um by Ben folding snow um for aligning frames um you know you can Bridge them to get people to think about things or policy makers to think about things in a new way you can amplify certain frames you can uh you can extend frames you know you can transform fames the the general point is that international non-governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations acting domestically um introduce these bring in or create these new frames that then um allow governments nation states and all the different entities involved in you know a Global Network transnational corporations are part of that the individual is a part of it allows them all to um rethink about and address Collective problems that are hurting everybody or helping everybody so an example is that ingos um develop a Fame uh through which besides climate change you know female genital cutting this uh VMware General cutting is a frame that originated uh in Western countries you know this this custom that is practiced and and certain Muslims African countries uh is is not a religion you know the idea that what is happening is not a religious it's not so much tied to religion but it might be judge religion but rather it goes against basic inalienable human rights and therefore um we need to uh proposed changing uh National regulation and and policing around it right um the idea that you're redefining General cutting not just not as a religious ritual religious thing but rather it's a medical problem um and if it's a medical problem and it's a human rights problem for human woman then you can bring in both foreign resources from the World Health Organization which is a very large intergovernmental organization um and you can you can motivate National governments to be police the activity I wanted also talk about um an alternative model for analyzing um but thinking about the world system um as a network theory of global governance we talked we talked about what governance means and uh if we then think that there are so many International Civic groups and internet there's International communities and igos and nation states that they're all creating different rules binding rules uh on certain aspects of how nation states can uh operate nation states signed treaties created and put together by intergovernmental organizations um all of this creates an overlap of authority um that challenges Nation States Supreme uh Authority within their territory um this idea of absolute supreme authority Global Order and Global governance according to uh um is comes out of this right it kind of comes out of its network of overlapping Authority and we should think about governance Networks they are different than just thinking about Aggregates of nation states um networks uh are complex right properties emerge from the system that we're not you can't tell just from the individual units um and they emerge from how this is the different act yeah actors like nation states interact uh within the system and government networks are a form of global governance they influence based on soft power based on persuasion they're influence by providing information the influence in a way that is opposite of hard power opposite of the realist perspective opposite like the idea that you're you have a military power you're going to threaten with your your goodness right the Paradox of globalization um is this need for a more Global governance um so Slaughter in the reading associated with this lecture describes how these networks interact um so an example is the kind of collaboration that happened afterwards 9 11. it was military cooperations for natural regulation freeze terrorists law enforcement in Many Nations shared information on terrorists the United States was coordinating in using other countries enforcement of other countries National laws to achieve U.S national security goals well you can think about like the interception of North Korean missiles on the way to Yemen as an example of global governance Network um it's something quite different than just individual states acting in their own self-interest with national sovereignty uh another example in your reading is the creation of uh something that's like the EPA uh by the Dutch the Dutch equivalent of the EPA um that was is an international network of Environmental Compliance and enforcement that offers technical assistance on environmental enforcement uh to agencies around the world well another example I just want to make sure you understand this would be like how National judges you know uh judges you know law is all national right nation state but the national judges exchange decisions through these International conferences they have these and judicial organizations that they're part of so for example Justice Kennedy on the United States Supreme Court when he was making a ruling on something in 2004 in his opinion that overturned to Texas Solomon Sodom Milan he cited a court case in the European court of justice um so just the fact that you have a national judge making a decision on a national case nevertheless citing an international Justice opinion or something happens in an international in another nation states Justice tells you that um nation states are not operating just in their own closed world but tied to these International governance networks with many entities involved so uh I also wanted to talk about what is meant by world society uh in your reading value talks about world society uh uh this is an idea that um yeah certain principles and models about how people understand things and how people think about things um uh and it's not just people you can also think about institutions of government so in in the bully reading um you'll see an explanation for why uh countries governments seem to all look very similar why do most countries have an education system that has primary secondary and then uh college education system uh and if you look at the number of years in each system they're all the same um uh why do most almost every country has ministries of uh health and ministries of uh foreign affairs they all look the same because the ideas of what constitutes a functioning uh up-to-date uh nation state that is uh current um comes from an idea that is war it comes from the idea of world culture right the idea that um the world all has an idea of what a a a normal functioning nation state looks like and and therefore the politicians and policy makers in a nation state say say we want to we are a up-to-date nation state so we want you to look like every other nation state um so you have to think about Nation what happens within the nation state being influenced by this broader Global ecosystem especially in ecosystem forms in which uh representatives of the state interact with each other share ideas on a global scale this is part of what Global Society is and why you see homogeneity a similarity an isomorphism in um the structures of nation states for this reason and finally I just want to point you out to the idea presented in your step in the Stagger reading that is uh not required but recommended for this week that uh there are different attitudes toward where uh the world is headed there's one idea promoted by David Held and his group is that there's such a we're going to become a global government where the street territorial units I.E nation states are no longer uh important um and they're just kind of dissolve away um and it will have like a U.N International Charter rights and a global legal system that everyone is part of and Global enforcement mechanisms you know the idea that uh we all become one state and then there are other people um the Skeptics Paul hust and others um that really say that's never going to happen and we live in a a global governance uh a world of global governance but not go Global government it's a very different to fix so how does global governance work in practice um the case study of the Kimberly process to certify conflict-free diamonds provides an example of how ingos ngos Global culture and nation states cooperate together to produce a public good and in this case that public good was ending a civil war problem with the Diamond Trading Angola Sierra Leone Liberia the DRC and Cote d'iv was fueling the continuation of the Civil War in central Africa so civil wars were being funded by the diamond industry um and by uh dealing with how uh the diamond industry uh got its diamonds uh it could uh invite creating a reason and incentive for the diamond is to follow its own Corporate social responsibility guidelines they had already developed uh there was an opportunity to reduce the money that was going to these different Rebel groups and continuing civil war Civil Wars in central Africa so major Diamond sellers like the beers had an incentive to access the cheapest diamonds and the collective action problem it would lose out to competition if it followed its own Copa social responsibility Islands when other Diamond producers did not have such guidelines or follow such guidelines in the U.S and Europe had incentives to keep the symbolism of diamonds is something that was positive so if if that was threatened uh that could impact um decisions Western consumers um in this uh situation had incentive to buy the cheapest diamonds everybody likes a good deal nation states had an incentive to develop policies that voters desired and so there were many different actors in this network of the diamond industry that had incentives to act against Collective action to that could end the finances of groups engaged in Civil War so um there were also other actors involved um that we don't always necessarily think of as Central but what major and important in eventually changing uh this situation um the UN was an intergovernmental organizations that establishes moral standards through U.N resolutions and in fact uh the UN had estab that had a U.N resolution in place they said don't fund uh these blood dumped by blood diamonds um but they had been they were ineffective they actually want work um the Gunther also domestic and non-governmental organizations um there was one called Global Witness um the accused abuse of purchasing conflict diamonds and violating this U.N security resolution which had passed in 1998 so the domain the the way that this process came about or how this cooperation game got changed to change incentives so that the beers and other Diamond Industries um producers had incentive to cooperate was the domestic ngos Global witness targeted policy making I mean Global witness set this up and then domestic ngos um targeted policy makers and individual officials Representatives uh nation states became allies in the non-governmental organizations campaign to develop a Kimberly process governments were impelled by these non-state actors and by global Society to address the issue it was because of American Jewelry industry was so scared of what might happen if there wasn't an agreement that they pushed the government to do the right thing so the American Jewelry industry put pushed how the era of Representatives and a congressman the U.S government and they pushed them to do so to to put pressure on uh the beers and the industry to participate in creating a a process to ensure that diamonds were not purchased from groups that were using the money to continue a civil war the NGO campaigns frame and golden conflict guidance as quote unacceptable corporate conduct um so instead of this being an international relations problem or a golden peace problem which is actually how it had always been looked at before um the NGO got people to think about um this as a problem caused by De Beers choice to be irresponsible non-transparent and unethical so the NGO Pastor debuts to follow its own existing code of conduct to be a responsible corporate Citizen and it put together a motto multi-ngo campaign Coalition and you both in the US and and Europe called fatal transactions that raise consumer awareness of the right to know so this targeted Diamond retailers and the payoff of following a strategy of purchasing one of the cheapest diamonds so it recast the symbolism of the industry because consumers were sensitized to care about diamonds Origins and this new fame threatened the entire industry there was concern about potential drop in demand um even though the ngo's campaign was not the goal was not to reduce demand the industry is worried it would reduce demand if they didn't find a way to ensure that uh the diamonds were not associated with Civil War and and blood times the campaign depicted human rights and law principles is being transgressed by the beers and other companies like them um and these companies were presented as aiding and abetting transgressors and as warmongers and you're in this you're reading actually details how quote Sierra Leone War atrocities were linked to the diamond industry galvanizing politicians in Western countries to support NGO goals and Industry leaders to act and cool so this network of nation states I GEOS I ngos and ngos developed this new Kimberly process Network um that was able to verify a network to verify that diamonds were not being purchased which would support a Civil War and this actually benefited industry participants so this conference verification had with those of you who are business majors another couple of you uh had material value in the marketplace to payoffs in the strategy games played by Diamond producers like the beers changed the result of this campaign cooperating with the Kimberly process provided benefits so companies companies gained more legitimacy from working with ngos um and this was rooted in a world cultural assumptions about the virtues of ngos AS Global champions of the poor the reason that ngos and international ngos could do this is that they had a reputation that worlds and worlds there was such a thing as war on society there is a famous word of society that they could tap into and so the power of this is so strong even one the NGO put out a report on Sierra Leone diamonds that was inaccurate called heart of the matter and inaccurate uh report the beers did not attempt to delegitimize it or delegitimize the NGO even though they they factually could have um and even though this NGO campaign if you raise awareness was it according to really not particularly effective um because there was a strategy change um by the uh dubious and there was a result of this defining a new form of corporate mystery responsibility in the diamond trade so the new interpretation of the meaning of diffusion out of actors going against uh Corporate social responsibility Norms would hurt the reputation of the country company and this reputation now had value because they were part of the Kimberly process so this case study demonstrates how International ngos and World culture erode uh Nation say sovereignty um but also have the concept of global governance is an extremely useful way for thinking about Trends and things and events that we see in the world and how they come about

Lecture 20	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r93Pfmac-9I
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

hi welcome to the start of part five of the course the cultural dimensions of globalization So today we're going to Define what is meant by culture and according to Steger cultural globalization is the intensification and expansion of cultural flows across the globe so I'm going to talk about cultural homogenation and cultural difference and then I'm going to talk about different approaches to investigating cultural dimensions of globalization so cultural exchange is something that has existed for as long as there has been trade and migration connecting the world together as long as empires have been conquering each other there's also been this process of exchanging items ideas art knowledge as long as there's been immigration of peoples has always been a root of trans transmission for new ideas and new cultures so one approach to studying culture Dimensions globalization is to examine trade flows around the globe and observe how the concomittant movement of cultural materials like statues of paintings and of cultural Concepts values knowledge uh move along with material Goods so for example we can think about ideas like the Buddhist and Enlightenment or Artistic Styles like the Buddhist lotus flower or specific values um and about what is considered high status so um as Buddhism expanded from its birthplace around the globe uh these Styles these values um these ideas also moved with it and in the 21st century there has been this increased transmission through Global media and new communication Technologies internet um of um ideas and and goods so the second approach that we going to talk about to examine culture Dimensions is to look at how changing Commodities and flows and changing resource flows affect local culture so at the end of the lecture I'm going to talk about the impact of sugar on British food culture there was an increase in the volume of sugar available and the price of sugar continuously uh fell over a couple of hundred years in the 17th 18th 19th centuries and this affected the local food culture of Britain so I'm going to talk about that cultural impact of a change in commodity flow and resource flow then the third approach to examining cultural Dimensions to consider Global I'm sorry is to consider the tools that we use to share ideas and to communicate language specifically language has been affected by globalization and this in turn affects how we as individuals interact with each other um there's this joke that the most spoken language in the world world is poorly spoken English because it's not the English of the United States or of Great Britain or um but a third kind of international English that is spoken by cosmopolitans all around the world um you know if you're speaking English as American or Britain or Carib the Caribbean some South Africa or bise where English is the the first language local language um you might associate that language with uh your identity as part of that Nation but if you speak English if you're from someplace else and you're speaking English as a second or a third language um when you speaking English you start to think of yourself at least a little bit as part of some Greater Community of English language speakers around the world so by changing languages um you in a small way change how you perceive of yourself and your place in the world and your relationship to other people and this gets back to this idea I talked about in the first to second lecture that stagger writes about the global imaginary the idea that a person is part of a group that is greater than just his or hers particular culture or Nation right so shared fluency in language um in English contributes to strengthening this idea so let's start by talking about what culture is when we're talking about the global Dimensions uh of of culture and the effects on culture of globalization it's important to know what culture is and to Define it and there are many many definitions of culture two very famous anthropologists back in 1952 published a list of 160 different definitions of culture the anthropologists were crober and clor and they were trying to capture what was meant when Scholars use that term culture things like material culture for example or non-material culture so material culture refers to the physical artifacts of a culture like piece of artwork it also refers to the Artistic Styles that are considered characteristics of the physical aspects of a culture so it includes the usage the consumption the creation the trade of objects and the associated related behaviors and norms and rituals that those objects create or take part in so for this reason the idea of material culture this concept also refers to things that are produced by culture but aren't necessarily physical so for example literature of a culture or the music of a culture also considered the material culture of a specific culture the second kind of um culture is nonmaterial culture another term for this is symbolic culture so when we talk about the values of a culture or the beliefs or the Customs or the morals of a culture or the symbols that are commonly shared in a culture um that's what we mean by non-material culture so if you even think about your own family which might have its own culture um when you're speaking to your parents or your siblings if you have them and you make a reference to something uh by using just one word instead of saying uh a whole set of sentences to refer to some specific event or to a larger concept that everyone in your family understands you're referring to they you're using some symbolic culture right you have a shared symbol with other members of of your family just like each of us in a culture has a shared symbols with other members of the share culture and having these shared symbols and having expected kinds of ways that we interact with each other and expectations about the behaviors of how other people will interact um these are all nonmaterial culture so we're in New York City but if we took a road trip down to the American South uh people would interact with us differently on the street uh there's a stereotype that Southerners are more polite uh they say hello um to each other on the street and if you don't it's considered very rude Us New Yorkers know that you you don't say hello to strangers on the street um randomly but being polite in the south is is the culturally accepted and expected way of interacting with people especially in public spaces um so this is just a simple silly example of a non-material so when we think about culture we also think about the mental processes that a culture teaches uh people to use and we think about the knowledge that a culture has so a lot of knowledge is passed along culturally um it might be knowledge about how to make a particular food dish that's uh symbolically important such as Thanksgiving turkey and stuffing um we use for Holiday it might be knowledge about the physical environment and how it works so for example to use uh the southern us again which was originally uh populated by colon colonists from a different part of England than the people that um populate ated New York or the Northeast so the culture is is the reason the culture is is different in the South um a lot of people in the South hunt with guns hunting is part of a lot of Southerners identity uh people go out with their parents uh or they go out with their uh uncles or aunts or or um and they love learn uh how to hunt how to use a gun um and it's part of the culture and this contributes to strong feelings about the right to own guns because there are practices and behaviors and experiences uh tied around the use of guns and in the New York where we most most of us do not do that uh we have very different General attitudes toward the right to own guns because uh our culture uh cultural relationship to physical element of a gun is different than on average in the South another thing that culture is is what we do so our behaviors what are correct behaviors what are incorrect behaviors you know how you expect people to act how people expect you to act so we might all As Americans expect that if we go to buy a car from a used car salesman he or she will lie to us about the quality of the car that we're looking at because that's the culture of use car sales we all know what to expect finally culture is what products we prod produce so this gets back to material culture it's a art reproduce it's a literature reproduce it's a music reproduce it's a products reproduce so this is all what culture is there are also um different properties of culture that I want to mention and there are five first thing about culture is culture is shared culture is not created by an IND individual it's created by a group of people second culture is learned it's passed down from one generation to the next from one person to the next from one group to the next it's something that can be learned it's symbolic I've talked about symbolism before but it fundamentally uses symbols when we interact with each other with the world we understand the world through symbols we interact and communicate through symbols language itself is a set of symbols so culture is symbolic things represent other things words represent Concepts the fourth property of culture is that it is integrated meaning that culture includes everything and all experiences one of the things that culture does is help us make sense of the world culture always has some sort of religious element even if your culture is atheism if you don't believe in religion nonetheless uh you participate and partake and we produce some sort of culture atheism is a culture relies on other things beside religion to make sense to the world uh but it does the same thing as many religions it does sense making it puts things together so that you understand that your behavior in one context is in integrated with your behavior in another context you can understand why X causes y um so culture and cultures the integrated aspect of it help people to connect cause and effect specifically and more broadly finally fifth Property culture is that it it is super organic that means that super is above meaning that it ex exists beyond the individual human character so when we talk about uh humans we're talking about humans as carriers of culture but culture is not in any single individual it's not even in a group of humans culture is super organic it exists somehow Beyond humans so for example um when I if I ask you what is white mean to you when you go to a hotel and take off the sheets and the bed and the bed sheets are always white always always always why is that pause for a minute while you think why your bed sheets always white bed sheets always white because in Western culture we associate white with the idea of Purity and the idea of cleanliness so when we go to a hotel we want to feel like the bedroom and the bed are clean that's why sheets are white white is a symbol for certain Concepts cleanliness Purity um so uh that is not something that is in a specific human a group of human but it is uh you know passed along um it is uh humans are the carriers of this cultural concept it gets pasted along so in the reading that's assigned for this lecture um you will see that there are even more definitions about what culture is um culture can be defined symbolically historically behaviorally normal Lively functionally struct structually I'm going to talk about um symbols in a minute but I just want to mention some of the less obvious ways to Define culture structural here means patterns of particular kinds of patterns and interrelated ideas and interrelated symbols and behaviors so all these things go together in a certain patterned way um so symbols don't just exist but symbols are used in a particular way often associated with with particular behaviors um or particular patterns of behavior I want to also talk about culture as and meaning system YZ is is a very famous Anthropologist who is read by uh many many people outside of anthropology because he was such an amazing Observer of reality and he gives this excellent definition of culture that is very helpful I'm going read it to you the concept of culture i espouse gites is essentially a semiotic one and I'm going to just explain semiotic means having to do with interpretation so gear is saying that the concept of culture that he uses is one that has to do with interpretation okay beginning with Max Weber Max Weber was a famous sociologist that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun I take culture to be those webs and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning so G goes on to say quote culture is public because meaning is systems of meaning and these are necessarily the collective property of a group when we say we do not understand the actions of people from a culture other than our own we are acknowledging a lack of familiarity with the imaginative Universe with within which their acts are science end quote so what G is saying is that our behaviors and our material culture and everything we do is part of a larger structure of culture everything is connected to a larger system which is a culture in which people are acting in the system of meaning so GS is saying that culture fundamentally is about meaning we make in our lives so remember back to a lecture on economics and I mentioned David Graber the economic anthropologist David greyber wrote about value and how value gives our lives purpose and meaning so we don't just go through life aimlessly doing things and aimlessly repeating and Performing cultural tropes we grew up with we use these because there's a meaning to what we do to how we think to how we express ourselves and then there's always obviously that search for meaning so different cultures have put the Human Experience together in different way and here it's is saying we need to understand how everything fits together to into webs of significance to create meaning and give our lives meaning meaning is not culturally systems of meaning and culture are con L negotiated and change so the relationship between a symbol such as a word or a specific behavior and its corresponding significance uh changes over time so I want to pause for a moment to discuss how meaning is Created from systems of symbols the meaning a symbol has is arbitrary so in Central Asia for example you make a hand like this as a symbol to show that you want to eat because um even though now people eat with forks and knives um and spoons uh traditionally they eat with their hand from a shared platter um and actually knives are associated with activities that are not eating such as cutting a work so the symbol in Central Asia for for certain parts of Central Asia for eating is is that um so one so it's arbitrary really what that symbol is for what it means um so through the spread of ideas that globalization genders you have these systems of meaning that are no longer tied to a specific specific location so when we say for example that um communities like Indian communities we've read about Indian communities in a lot of our readings um move to New locations and they transport the culture uh it means that they transport in particular elements of the meaning system and symbols these symbols meaning systems interact with the dominant culture to where people have moved um or the dominant Global theme like ideology like neoliberalism and we get this interaction and there's a term for that and it's gloal g l c a this is the idea that there are local patterns and culture elements that interact with other cultures so local cultural practices in a specific Place acquire a new meaning in that specific place because they're interacting with global cultures or cultures in ideas that have been imported from other places and there's this hybrid interaction so for example think about McDonald's in Japan which looks very different from traditional Japanese food but also significantly different from McDonald's in the US or think about French rap music rap music is a particular style of music that comes from the US um French uh is a a languag is not originally associated with that style but you've had French rap music for for decades now there's this hybrid interaction and we observe hybridization with every immigrant group that comes to America um and we can also see the impact of hybridization if we look at the values and practices of immigrant groups in a new place like America and compare it to what's happening with the people who live in the place where they came from the old country wherever that is um usually these are quite different because in any one place a culture is constantly changing but if you have an an immigrant group has come to a new place and they've hybridized their culture uh with the new culture um then it it would look different also you may have such a big immigrant group that comes to a new place that they're able to partially isolate themselves um so you have um Italian Americans that come or indian-americans in the Northeast who have large um communities um and those communities can be big enough that they maintain the culture that exists when the majority of those people came um and uh so and and they just reproduce just that culture um because they're fighting against uh the dominant culture in which they are now Loc ated so um so you can look at indian-americans in New Jersey and they might act in and have behaviors and ideas and values that may seem different or are different than their counterparts and or been moved by for example who have constant who stayed in the original place in the culture has changed but um the the Immigrant Community has has maintained the culture of when the majority of people came um so when we try and understand and compare and contrast culture one way to do that is to look at material culture and look at what is the same and what is different so um again the definition of material culture the material artifacts that any culture produces um and we can ask what is the same around the globe so is there a homogenization of culture and many people have argued that and they have even argued that Western culture industry underwrites the homogenization of culture around the globe so for example if you go shopping at Ikea pretty much anywhere in the world the Ika will look exactly the same the products offered will be exactly the same they will have the same names um even if you're literally Halfway Around the World um or when we see Nikes worn by amera Indians in the Amazon um or when we find bands of Manchester United in the farthest corners of of the world these are all examples of the homogeneization of culture so one um culture that has uh become Global and that everybody U uses and participates homogenization is the opposite of cultural diversity there's this very obvious argument that local culture is lost when uh culture becomes Americanized or westernized marginalized some people even call this cultural imperialism a new kind of imperialism right um and certain cultural communities have tried to put up barriers to stop the constant import of Western culture American culture the French who are Western for example for for a time one time a while ago they put tariffs on American films because they wanted to support their own cultural industry so I want to give one example of homogenization or the loss of certain kinds of cultural practices and differences um I don't know if you have heard the term the Spanish Siesta the Italians have a term for a very similar thing the Italian reposte uh the Greeks have the term meary and this is all the same thing it's pretty much the idea that uh at lunchtime you have an extended break and you take a big lunch and you take a very short nap and then uh you go back in the afternoon and you open the store or continue work until later in the evening so tradition Ally stores would close from 12 or 1:00 uh sometimes two and they would close until 4 and then reopen up at at 4 o'clock and stay open uh later than usual in the US until 8 o'clock um with global work with the northern European work American work culture the n95 culture dominating um work practices over the past 20 30 years this practice of the Siesta repul messiner has pretty much disappeared in southern Mediterranean countries so there is a debate in the International Studies Community about cultural homogenization versus glocalization um and the hybridization and constant changing or reinvention of local culture and arguments are made on both sides right um just because a culture is importing certain elements from a dominant culture it doesn't necessarily mean that a culture is becoming homogenized uh with that dominant culture it could be becoming hybridized so one of the big Concepts I hope you get out of this class is to be able to ask this question critically think about both the idea of sameness and the idea of uh globally circulating systems of meaning finally when you think about global culture remember that cultural uh this includes cultural systems of meaning so ideas like individualism or consumerism or certain religious discourses like the global Catholic church or Global Islam these are all ideas and Concepts that are shared globally and these can take over and push against Concepts that are locally produced or that are local and have an alternative understanding or meaning system um even if they don't replace they um a local culture they may affect the local culture by pushing against it right um and we especially see this in hybridization think about uh the global Catholic church and what happens on November 1st which is All Saints Day when you go and you remember the dead you go to your ancestors Graves you take care of it um in in Mexico this um interacted with uh traditional uh practices and so in Mexico you see the Day of the Dead with its own very specific uh symbols and practices and um um that is a hybridization of this November 1 and and whatever comes from other uh Indian uh Traditions uh prior to Colombian Conquest so I want to now talk about the three different ways of uh looking at at the globalization of culture and the impact of um globalization on culture and the first way is to look at the transcultural flows of material culture right so think about music think about theater think about sports and let's use music as an example individuals who aren't physically in the same location obviously can listen to and participate in the creation enjoyment of a particular type of music and these are particular types of music are tied to particular cultures that create them it's possible to create and maintain links to a particular group if you listen to that group's music even if you're not there so one penny cook she writes about this she says music can nourish the idea of imagined communities right the idea of a community that isn't necessarily physical but is in your head created um we can also think about the fusion of Music where musicians from entirely different contexts come into contact with each other and create entirely new forms of music so you may have heard of cross something called crossover music um you Ricky Martin he's quite old now uh was considered one of the first crossover artists to mix Spanish and English in in America um or think about um Bad Bunny uh who sings in Spanish and English and has loyal audiences in multiple countries he was just on uh Saturday Night Live I think recently or think about the whole genre of music afro poop it's um has many different musical influences and numerous local language have been Incorporated and combined to together um in afropop um finally let's use rap music um and the fact that rap music is now in every local language you know you can even the Sammy reindeer herders in Lapin Finland which is the furthest North part of Finland some of them uh make rap music in the Sami language and distribute it on the internet this is a way according to um anthropologists that they can maintain their own language which is dying um and dying out U boy Bose is an anthropologist he says this type of thing of rapping in a local language doesn't just preserve a language but preserves an identity uh rap music is a way of talking about your identity um and it's very clearly about identity so the transcultural flows uh media music is one of these right in media um they actually can do three things first individuals in a diaspora in a group of people that no longer have a culture that are no longer in a same specific place they're able to remain connected to their own music and their own culture uh um new music can be created as a function of contact and globalization in the trans Global movements right again alop poop is an example and finally music can uh help uh maintain uh local culture local languages um because they are tied and connected to musical forms that are are popular like Samy rap music so the second approach to studying culture dimension of globalization is to look at the impacts of culture on the uh globalization of a commodity or the globalization of a commodity on culture and I'll just give a hint to please pay attention to this uh it may be on on your final exam and I want to give an example of sugar uh because it really uh the history of sugar and the changing meaning of sugar in um in Britain really is a good example of how changing commodity flows can affect local culture there is a famous Anthropologist Sydney Mintz he wrote a history of sugar um and he looked at how between the 17th and 19th centuries 1600s to 1800s um sugar use change in Britain and back in 17 and 18 uh in 17 1800 British Sugar consumption per person quadruple it went up 400 times so um it w it was four pounds per person in 17 and 1800 um and and then it went up to 18 pounds per person in Britain you saw this change the same pattern was not seen in France which also had sugar colonies um but um in in Britain sugar was a commodity that became a quote culturally defined good to quot Ms and sugar had m mle functions some of these functions of sugar were as an indicator of status or as a replacement for dairy or as a food uh food for substance right calories or as a medicine as a spice condiment as a decorative material preservative sweetener sugar had many uses and functions and these were tied to specific cultural practices and ideas and they changed over this 300 year period so mince Sydney mince investigates how throughout the 1700 the British people became used to sweetness right and they developed a Reliance on sugar that wasn't there before so just to set the stage sugar was originally a luxury item if we talk about like in the 8th century 700s and going forward there was a luxury item in Europe and it was very expensive and hard to get um until about the 15 to 1600s when the sugar colonies began to be established um they they were established in Brazil in South America in the Caribbean and the supply of sugar and the production of sugar began to increase and therefore the price of sugar began to fall and at the start of the sugar boom if we look at culturally how was sugar used um in Europe and in in Britain it was used as a medicine or as a spice in food so sweetness doesn't just sugar doesn't just have sweetness right it changes the balance of flavors in a dish right that's what we mean when we say spice um sometimes when you make a pasta sauce a tomato sauce for your pasta very often people will add a little bit of sugar to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes that's what is meant by a a spice and that's how sugar was used it was used as a spice and this use peaked in the 16th century um much of the medieval food I'm medieval British food right in that period was was um also preserved um it was salted um and it was spiced in order to preserve it so another way that sugar was used initially in Britain was as a preservative if you you know we all eat Jam or we all we've heard of preserved um preserved uh sugar orange po or something sugar can high sugar content can preserve things right and sugar this is all while sugar remained relatively expensive um but as it started to become more available but still expensive the very rich started to use sugar to construct sugar sculptures and so it's used as a spice in cooking began to disappear and it began to be used uh for the sugar sculptures this was actually a technique that was originally imported from North Africa and Egypt but it spread throughout the nobility in Britain you would take sugar and you would combine it with oil from from nuts right or vegetable gums and you create this clay sugar clay and it was then hardened and people would make these sculptures they call them s doties um and show them off at Banquets um it would be of buildings of animals they would be for decoration and subtleties were used in Banquets to denote a certain social status because they were very expensive only only Aristocrats and and and and the King could uh could afford them but as the price of sugar inevitably fell in the 1500 1600s um the very very rich Merchants began to also have subtleties these sculptures at their Banquets because um you know cultural practices generally flow downward um from the the higher status to the lower statuses so by the 16th century these merchants started to copy this practice um so it wasn't just the aristocracy um and by 1660 middle of the 1700 sugar had become much cheaper and much more common um and as it became more common the use of sugar lost its status symbol um having it making sties no longer was considered the sign of uh an ated rank um but what you did instead was you stuffed your guests with sugar according to Sydney Mintz the Anthropologist um then the price of sugar kept falling and it started to be used for a substitute for dietary reasons for yeah so um you much more sugar was being produced and there needed to be a demand for that sugar and one way that demand was created was to spread the consumption or use of sugar downward to the lower classes into to the poor because the lower classes always want to imitate the upper classes the merchants always want to imitate the aristocracy right so um the lower classes began to consume sugar in Greater quantities especially as the price became cheaper and cheaper and and the poor eventually the poor began to consume it but the way they consumed it was not creating sculptures or eating cookies uh but they consumed it for the purpose of it was so cheap that it was the cheapest kind of source of calories so around 1700 the and afterwards the consumption of sugar was um exploited and uh the lower classes in Britain began to consume things like tea with sugar now know this is the idea that we have our tea with sugar part of the kind of national character of Britain or um they began to eat Jam which is mostly sugar and some fruit on bread and they began to the poor began to eat Jam as a replacement for dinner because Jam has calories and it's cheaper than milk or other food products it's cheap calories um so as the poor began to consume more and more sugar uh the rich started to consume less of it so by 1800 what you saw was um that there was sugar in every English person's diet and by 1900 20% of all the calories in the English diet or obtained from sugar so this story that mince tells shows how the global production system of sugar which created more and more sugar you know first it was under a mertile economic system we learned about then it was under a capist system but these created an increased productivity of sugar production made it cheaper to consume and it had in effect step by step on the food culture of British Society so here we see the globalization of a commodity impacting um a culture and the dietary patterns of a culture so that's the second way to think about the uh globalization of of culture and the effect of globalization on culture so the third approach St globalization is to look at the globalization of languages language is an indicator of cultural change right so think about the rising use of English of Spanish of Chinese as the the lingua franka or the global language um for people to communicate this has implications for culture because um the language affects perception and cognition um there's a famous hypothesis um in linguistic anthropology uh called The sapio Warf hypothesis and this hypothesis is that the structure of a language affects a speaker world view so languages emphasize certain things and they downplay other things so someone's perception of something is in a small way relative to the Lang language that he or she uses to describe it sapir wrote this he's wrote quote human beings do not live in an objective world alone nor alone in the world of social activity as ordinarily understood but are very much at the mercy of a particular language which has become the medium of expression for their Society it is quite an illusion to imagine that one adjusts to reality essentially without the use of language that language is merely an incidental means of solving specific problems of communication or reflection the fact of the matter is that the real world is to a large extent unconsciously built upon the language habits of the group no two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality the worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds not merely the same world with a different labels attached we see here in other words experience very largely as we do because the language of our community predispose certain choices of interpretation end quote and sep's colleague Warf this is where you get the the seir warf hypothesis colleague his colleague Warf continued on he's Warf said we cut nature up organize it into Concepts and ascribe significances as we do largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language the agreement is of course an implicit and unstated one but its terms are absolutely obligatory we cannot talk at all except by subscribing to the organization a classification of data which the agreement creates end quote so for example if you regularly speak a language in which you must pick a form of second person address so you mark your relationship to your interlocutor so in Spanish it would be two you use two the two uh which means you right for friends and for family and those people are socially subordinate but then you use for you for those people are socially above you uh for those people with whom you don't have a close connection the French have two versus four the Italians have the same thing right um in this case if you're using a romance language you are categorizing every person you talk to in terms of the relevant social Dimensions with respect to you so according to the sappia warf hypothesis this changes how you perceive what is going on in the world um and so in this way language affects culture and language affects individuals and culture affects individuals and if you change uh the language um you are changing um your relationship to the world and the meaning of certain things so once stagger writes in the textbook the you read for this lecture that English and Chinese are becoming major languages in the world today think about what this means for how people perceive certain environments in which they live and think about the fact that the number of languages spoken in the world have decreased from about 14,500 unique languages in 1500 to only about 6,300 unique languages in the 21st century think about how therefore globalization changes the diversity we have in perceiving the world so this concludes uh the lecture we talked about defining culture we talked about the culture of homogenation and difference and we talked about three different approaches for investigating cultural dimensions of um globalization

Lecture 21	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHZu3aS7uMs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

so today I'm going to talk about cultural homogenization and globalization of culture and we're going to discuss two different texts assigned with this lecture one is about Bollywood and the other about Hollywood and we're going to explore the idea of how culture moves around the globe so cultural homogenization is this idea that through the forces of global ation local culture is being lost to a few dominant cultures which are ascendant and cema is a really great subject with which to observe these Trends because Cinema is a strong carrier of culture and when we talk about cultural homogenization homogenization is a form of imperialism in that the dominant Community extends its Authority by replacing or transforming a non-dominant community or the culture of a non-dominant community and this kind of cultural imperialism can be driven by the market or it can be driven by force so if we think about the Spanish conquistadors in the new world they forced the elites um of these cultures that they uh that they dominated to become Catholic to read in Spanish to like the Aztec they said that the azex could not longer transmit the traditional cultures um and this is this is one way that um culture can be homogenized another way is just through um the marketplace America has been accused of cultural imperialism by exporting its cultural products you know of our own culture right these products these films for example this music replace local products and then contribute to extinguishing features of the traditional ways of life so one driver of cultur imperialism is easier access to foreign culture through the dismantling of trade barriers right and through domestic policies uh that no longer support local cultural industry so we talked about neoliberal ideologies in an earlier section of the class um and these support some of the things you this Market driven cultural domination in the reading by Cohen assigned with this lecture Cohen mentions that France uh props up their domestic production uction of cultural products right of film and um TV things because they have this quota system they tell TV stations that TV stations must show a minimum number of hours um or percentage of what they show a minimum amount of domestic films so this creates a market for French for produced films or and and these films might be overpaid for right or whatever but they have to show them right or there might be restrictions like in India for many many years it's no longer true but for many years they said you could not dub foreign films into uh Hindi or or local languages um and if you're not allowed to dub foreign films in local languages then you have a smaller audience this is no longer the case but this was one one this was at one point um these are ways that countries try have tried in the past to fight cultural imperialism and to uh reduce the influence of foreign cultural products as foreign culture invades a local cultural space um foreign cultural products carry with them foreign values transmit foreign values foreign aspirations foreign orientations you know it's been argued that American films for example promote certain values like individualism or heroism or Ro rantic uh self-fulfillment or entrepreneurship right so one thing are these new ideas they're carried by cultural products but the other thing is um new symbols that are introduced so in the US eating french food for example is considered to be something that's very high class or in Asia in the 1990s and 2000s when McDonald's was just being introduced into Asia and into China eating there symbolize something very different than what it means to eat McDonald's in America at that period eating at McDonald's in China symbolized participation in um and self-identification as a Cosmopolitan Global citizen uh the there were tablecloths at McDonald's it was a a much uh higher Social Status uh uh experience right so new symbols and new symbolic meanings of signs are transmitted through the transmission of cultural products okay one idea second idea I want you to to learn is that one another driver of homogenation homogenization of culture or cultural imperialism is the creation of a global culture and this is something that many people especially the El leites in urban areas asire to they aspire to be participate in a global culture right um and they want to feel you want to feel that you're part of a global Cosmopolitan group of people that are beyond your your nation right and um so you might dress in a certain way because that's what everybody around the world is is dressing that way now um and or um you might watch a certain film because it is momentarily popular around the world like the Barbie film that came out this summer uh it was shown all around the world at the same time and actually as Hollywood produces in markets films it does so toward a global audience um so the culture Style and characteristics of Hollywood Cinema are um specific toward oriented toward a global uh consumption so Cohen in his AR article that you read argues that there are a couple characteristics we see in in the style of Hollywood for this reason dialogue is really pretty General um because you want something that can be translated in multiple languages um action is preferred over settle dialogue right uh the comedy the comedy film becomes more physical because you know when you're translating language-based uh humor or pun-based tumor into another language it doesn't translate very well so if you know you're aiming for a global audience you're to make sure that that's not in there right in general you're creating a universal product means that movies become more relevant to the general features of a human condition rather than the specifics of a a culture a local place um but some critics have argued that it leads to kind of movies that formul right um these are some of the negatives of cultural homogenization and and when you are have a global audience and are creating for that Global audience Cohen talks about a concept that also is relevant to understanding the production of of movies right he talks about economic clustering and he talks about how economic clustering contributes to cult imperialism and the creation of uh the production of global culture right clusterin is a very specific thing it means the spatial concentration of all the different elements that go into creating a final product so for specific kinds of films Hollywood needs to line up Stars producers directors screenwriters the money the financing right the marketing the studios uh it needs to be able to evaluate the assets and forecast demand for a particular uh style of movie they're producing um and all these elements go into production and so the idea of economic clustering means that they're all in one physical Geographic space that makes it easier to coordinate all the these different pieces that go into movie making so clusters in the film industry is very different than what you read about when you read about flexible work in that Castell piece in the economic section of this class right remember cellus argues that the economy now can separate out different parts of the production cycle into different Geographic places and this can help lead to the use use of flexible time workers but also just the spreading out and of of production systems um and costelli says that it and telecommunication technology lets us put it all back together um essentially geography doesn't matter here Cohen is saying something quite opposite uh when you're making a movie or making art the clustering of all these different elements is very important they need to be in the same place um and by being in the same place you have this natural advantage in the global Marketplace everything is one place uh you know Hollywood everything's in one place Hollywood is also a very large market for movies um the American Market is very large um so money uh can be invested in the production value of a movie and more money can be invested in a movie in Hollywood than someplace else meaning the quality can be better than somebody else meaning you beat out their competing movies that's that's the idea Hollywood is expert at creating entertaining movies um of the highest quality you know this contrasts with movies um that are dramas or historical movies or tied to a particular culture or speak to a small audience um Hollywood creates these very these movies that are generally popular um and which can be sold worldwide but because there's so much money to be made they can spend a lot of money on creating the production value of it is highest right and now I want to talk about Bollywood so this is a map of Bollywood it is in Northern India and in the name you see that there's a mix very obviously of Bombay and Hollywood Bombay is the old name for Mumbai which is India's commercial Hab so if we return to this idea of culture as symbols uh even the name Bollywood symbolizes uh something cinema around the world right because it's got Hollywood in there so present day Bollywood it's also known as a Hindu film industry it emerged from people who came from Punjab in the 1940s and 50s and they produce movies in Hindu uh and and Hindi is a language is spoken as the first language second language or third language by 58% of the population as of 200 14 in India and Hindi films took in about 43% of all box office revenue in India these Hindu language films are not the only films available in India um and Bollywood is not the only film industry in India either there are many film Industries which are organized around other languages that spoken in the subcontinent you know Tamil ugu malayam right these are some of the major languages each language has its own film industry in India these other film Industries get some some support and recognition from the the used to from this state of India because India uh considered itself until kind of recently to be a multinational State um Bollywood was interesting that Bollywood even though is makes a lot of money and super well known was not supported by the the state it wasn't considered part of this film industry in India until 1998 it took two decades to Ling for them and so not being part of this industry you know actually means certain things it means it's more difficult to obtain loans um from Banks um it's more difficult to be given the same rights and Privileges and legal protections that uh recognized film Industries in India are given um but nonetheless uh and it means that a lot of the financing of films are harder to come by one quarter of Bollywood films um are financed by money lenders or um these are people who lend money at 40 to 60% interest every year um and it's what you do where you look for money when you can't get money um from more traditional established Banks right and you might wonder why this is one of the main reasons is that supporting the use and cultureal production in these minority languages um were part of a conservative effort to promote multiculturalism in the government now India under Modi it's gone the opposite direction so here we're talking about uh P many many decades when India very much considered itself multinational multi- many groups and uh they supported this idea through the support of culture um financial support was also given to movies that promoted National policy um or for films that had a political message so that's why baliwood was not supported by the state of India whereas other film smaller other film agencies in these other languages were being supported now that's not to say that Bollywood wasn't being protected in India until 1992 um there were tariffs that be not important films and there's restrictions I told you about dubbing foreign films into Hindi so so now I want to play for you this trailer shows you um some of the key characteristics of this Masala style as um Bollywood style is is described right there's singing dancing shifts between emotional highs and lows it's all in a single scene there dance numbers right um you see Western and Eastern dance and Western and Eastern uh dress um and there's this hybrid of both Styles it's also called an Omnibus form it combines melodrama action comedy romance social comedy th this is all according to your reading assigned with this lecture by tidel right so some of these key characteristics of Bollywood films are not just the style I just described but also um the fact that Bollywood films are similar to Hollywood films because they're both escapists right but Bollywood films use Indian Styles and Indian symbols and Indian forms and Bollywood films are very much produced for internal consumption um which fundamentally makes them different from uh B Hollywood Blockbusters right Hollywood Blockbusters are produced for a global audience Bollywood films are produced for the local uh hind speaking audience but people around the world like to watch them right so since they're not produced to be exported worldwide um they are quite different than Hollywood now both are similar in the fact that both are produced to be commercial successes um and they're not necessarily making a political statement um they're not like an independent film right Bollywood films are produced to be successful in the box office just like Hollywood films what tidel says is that even though Bollywood films are a commercial product looking for Success it's not like the devoid of nationalistic content or anti-colonialist content they're very much nationalistic they're at the same time they're escapists um but tidow says that they're ideologically loaded his quote right um so Bollywood movies are interesting because they are seen both as defending Indian values against Western values but at the same time they are dangerous couriers of Western values because you see Western and Eastern things combined right some of these Western values are like the idea of true love right true love is opposed to arranged marriages um which is still very common in India I have friends that were arranged marriages in they their marriage was arranged in India um so you see all this in this trailer right so think about Bollywood through these concepts of hybridity that we talked about and through the concepts of cultural flows I talk talked about um and you can begin to get a better analysis of of of what Bollywood is right and how B the prevalence of B Bollywood and what you see in the movies uh has something to do with globalization and is influenced by globalization right there's an incorporation of Western elements in Bollywood movies but there Bollywood movies are maintaining the cultureal integrity and upholding local values um and so if you think about movies from Bollywood that way you can start to make sense another film critic Bedford writes that it's to quote him the obligatory song and dance sequences of the Indian mainstream films are a striking example of indigenously produced and based aesthetic principles with remote antecedence in the traditional Sanskrit drama um that's that's one analysis of Bollywood another analysis comes from Misha she says Bollywood is qu ultimately conforming popular Indian Cinema is so conservative and culturally specific that it makes a radical postcolonial India cinema impossible Misha's idea is that Bollywood is not completely radical and it's also not unrelated to traditional forms Indian Sima incorporates both traditional forms and traditional ideas as well as new forms so you might ask this question if we see that Hollywood films have replaced a lot of the cinema from other countries from other cultures um has Hollywood supplanted Bollywood in India so Tyra in the piece you read raises this question and she says actually it has not Hollywood actually performs pretty poorly in India because these two Cinema Traditions are really very different and they don't compete they meet different needs so the reason that Bollywood has not been supplanted by Hollywood is that the two very different systems of meanings and symbols between the global audience of Hollywood and the Bollywood audience so even though both genres are Escapist very much um the symbols the Styles the values don't compete and they're fundamentally different and they meet different needs so uh tidel says these modes a presentation of both Escapist as it said that but the Classic Hollywood mode like song and dance numers uh are used to play on deep tensions between wealth and poverty and hope and fear in Indian films um so these Escapist forms of song and dance um are interpreted in a Bollywood film as having specific meanings um having social commentaries whereas if if you see a song and dance in a Hollywood film it doesn't it's not making a comment on on society or on something is going on rather it's uh just purely Escapist so this is why western films have done badly in in India so the other point I want to make is that there is a star system in India that allows movie stars to transform the social capital um that they develop on the screen into Political Capital so um a number of stars have become politicians there's no separation of status between a movie star and a politician uh in the US we don't have that yeah we have Trump and Ronald Reagan and Ronald Schwarzenegger governor former governor of California but those are exceptions right we think of Politics as separate and not overlapping transferable set of skills but in India it's part of the same system so there are a number of reasons um that why we don't see the cultural imperialism of Hollywood film making overtaking local filmm in India um and the theories introduced in your readings by Cohen and Tido explain cultural globalization Trends and show that just relying on the single concept of cultural imperialism is not enough or sufficient to explain what we see in in Bollywood so I uh just want to make you aware that every theory has a lens uh and the lenses Theory theoretical lenses illuminate But Blind analy to certain elements right uh so if you're only looking at Bollywood through the lens of cultural imperialism you're not going to be able to understand or think about why Hollywood hasn't been successful

Lecture 16	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Je-XjVhnQ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

today we're going to be talking about environmental problems and specifically kinds of dilemmas and problems that are about the environment that are collective and cause Collective and consequence and collective in scope that are essentially global so I'm going to talk about three things in today's lecture one is I'm going to tell you about public goods and public bads he's maybe tons you've heard of before I'm going to talk to you about global environmental problems and we're going to go a little bit in depth about global climate change as an example of of how this works the definition of a public good is something from which a benefit is produced and when the benefit is produced individuals other actors other entities can't be excluded from those benefits or you know the benefit in other words the benefits don't dwindle just because uh other people perceive them so an example of a public good is Public Safety in New York City or International Peace so let's talk about Public Safety in New York City just because I benefit from there being a good police presence doesn't take away from somebody else benefiting from that police presence well let's talk about International Peace if you have failed nation states like Syria they produce terrorism they produce refugees they produce all sorts of things that are bad for nation-states for other nation-states these are public bads but the good is the opposite of public bad right and if there is peace if there are stable States then everybody around the world benefits so it's actually in the self-interest of everybody um every country in the world to pay money and support forces peacekeeping forces diplomatic forces diplomatic activities to keep States from failing um and so that's why we have you know a global system a peacekeeping why countries support you know pay money to the United Nations and contribute funds another example would be you know reducing greenhouse gas emissions um Every Nation suffers from the negative effects of climate change and every country contributes to the problem and actually every country's contribution to the problem impacts every other country so um it's a a public good or it's a reduction of a public bad if um greenhouse gas emissions methane CO2 other greenhouse gases can be reduced and you can't really exclude other countries you know once the US and China and Europe begin to reduce the greenhouse gas emission emissions you can't tell you know North Korea who isn't participating in reducing that they can't enjoy the benefits of the greenhouse gas reduction you can't you can't um and and them enjoying the benefits doesn't take away from other people and joining amendments then this is definition of a public good or a public bad related to a public good is something called a common pool good and the lit is a little more um in depth but for those of you watching who are interested a common pool good is like a public good in that um it is difficult to exclude other people from enjoying the benefits of a common pool good um but it's different from a public good because just like in a public good one person's receiving a benefit of the public good doesn't take away from someone else's receiving the benefit a common pool good one person's benefiting from a common pool good does take away from other people benefiting from it so an example of this would be an aquifer which is underground water storage or a fishery you know a pond with fish in it or a part of the sea that is the where you know lobsters live um if you if if clavisa and Abdul and kahem and Maddie and I if the five of us are all fishing in the pond uh maybe we take out so many fish in one year that then total number of fish decreases every year and we keep fishing and we keep decreasing decreasing decreasing so um uh that's how a public good is different from a common pool good this idea of a public good or a common poor good actually is very important to understanding um you know how we take care of our natural world and in 2012 the Nobel Prize was actually awarded to to uh people one in Economist one a political scientist Eleanor Ostrum on Douglas North who uh showed that um common pool Goods even though it is very very difficult to exclude people from them this is the definition of it it's not impossible um but there's a lot of costs in organization and and management around that but because you can if you build that up um exclude people or set up rules for managing common pool Goods it is possible to sustain resources like forests like aquifers like Fisheries um like congested public roadways there are ways to organize management of common pool Goods that allow them and ensure that they are not overused and then disappear um and so creating public goods producing public goods mitigating public bads or effectively managing common pool resources all require cooperation require cooperation among uh uh the people that that are harvesting resources or the people that need to contribute uh the resources to create that public good and what do you need for cooperation you need coordination you need people to coordinate or entities to coordinate what they're doing and you need communication right you need communication to um so everybody knows what everyone else is doing and just to understand the scope of the problem and so this is one of the reasons that intergovernmental organizations are so important to a global ecosystem in a governmental organizations they make it less costly to communicate and less costly to coordinate they essentially alter the Dilemma that nation states are embroiled in by saying uh by by providing a um a a effective a cost-efficient way to coordinate to solve a problem I want to talk about Global Environmental Collective action problems because when we talk about coordination we're really talking about Collective action global environmental Collective action problems are problems that are not territorial based not just in one territory and they affect the entire globe so we could think of lots of different environmental problems that fit this definition um and all of these Global Environmental Collective action problems are either involve either public goods or common pool Goods so again we can talk about deep sea fishery health or verbal carbon cycling or climate change I want to provide a a really clear definition of what Collective action is and the concise Oxford dictionary and politics and international relations provides one they say Collective action is any situation in which the uncoordinated actions of each player may not result in the best outcome he or she can achieve so that is a definition of Collective action and so what that means is that a collective action dilemma occurs when there are negative incentives um food that players for the actors for the entities for the individuals whoever um there are incentives that discourage these entities these individuals from joint action um so even if uh every if there's a case where if every entity cooperated then that sum total of the benefits would be much much greater and as a matter of fact if everybody cooperated then each individual country this the total for them um would be better if they could guarantee that everyone else also cooperated so there are many cases like that but because um you don't know that everybody is going to cooperate it makes sense for you to not cooperate while everybody else cooperates and then you can get an even bigger payoff you know so an example would be with um um you know climate change and whether you're going to let your factories produce a bunch of CO2 if you could guaran you know if you if you use a type of energy production that produces a lot of CO2 but make it very very cheap energy such as burning coal you have a competitive advantage against all the other countries if the other countries are agreeing to not produce CO2 when they produce energy right then you have a competitive advantage and that you can beat them out now overall um over time as you have climate change and the very costly effects of climate change your country is going to have to pay more to deal with the effects of climate change than if everybody agreed to cut emissions um but in this particular environment since you can't guarantee that everybody else will also uh cut emissions you're incentivized your best strategy to come out the winner this one time is to burn a bunch of coal and produce a bunch of CO2 so this is the idea of a collective action dilemma any situation in which the uncoordinated action of each player may not result in the best outcome that that individual player can achieve if everybody coordinated their actions and there are again numerous environmental and ecological Collective action problems that exist so some examples of collective action problems population growth um genetically modified organisms spreading into the wild and not being contained on on on on farms that are only growing GMOs right um biodiversity loss Global Collective action problem um global warming trans boundary pollution like CFCs that destroy the ozone layer or nitrous oxide sulfur dioxide or acid rain those uh the the this kind of pollution does not recognize jurisdictional nation-state boundaries right deforestation so um the conversion of the Amazon into soybean uh plantations or palm oil plantations or pasture for uh International beef trade Global Collective action problem um fishery collapse due to global warming or just overfishing um finding food insecurity also Global action Collective action problem um so for example in 2007 to 2008 again 2010 to 2012 um the food prices around the world reached an all-time high and this led to riots in 14 different countries due to food um and yeah there were actually multiple causes of it which is partly why part of the Museum's Collective action problem it wasn't just one cause you know yes there was a climactic aspect to it like Cyclones um in 2008 in the rice growing regions of Asia that reduced food supply but there were also just kind of global patterns of wheat use wheat being used for industrial feed right to feed animals um and as we as a world eat more animals because the world has become becoming richer we use more grains um also just simply um oil the impact of oil prices and what they do to food prices we don't usually think oil and food are connected but actually they are when oil prices go up which they did um people look for substitutes like biofuels biofuels are made from maize they're made from sugarcane so you start to take agricultural land that could be used for wheat production and in other times is and people grow Maize and and so and whatever uh sugar so that means that we there's less supply of wheat right um and then also oil um as oil prices rise people change and they stop using oil from the ground and they start to use natural gas but natural gas is an input to uh fertilizer and fertilizer um uses a lot of uh natural gas so when um oil places went up in 2008 to knock on effect was that fertilizer prices went up 300 percent and when fertilizer prices go up it means uh people use less of it and there's less food production um and and there were other contributing factors to the the this outcome of Global Food prices being as high as they ever have been um but you know the food market is global and these are all Global uh Trends and patterns and so this is a global Collective environmental Collective action problem food prices because it it needs to be addressed by coordination and cooperation um and if every one everybody just acts in their own interests um we get these food spikes that lead to food riots right so those are some examples of Global Environmental Collective action problems I want to also talk about why many of these Collective action problems are complex they're not simple and climate change is a a good example of this so I'm going to use that they're complex because number one we're not talking about just one kind of public good or common pool good that gets affected by these in global environmental problems climate change affects Fisheries fishery Health it affects coastlines right as as sea level rises it affects agriculture you know we think about the droughts the result from it it effects um you know cost of insurance for wildfires and just public lands because the more wildfires within with um climate change there were 87 000 wildfires in 2019 so one reason is more complex second reason the extent of these Global environmental problems are multi-scale meaning that there are consequences that occur at the regional level or the local level but also at the hemispheric level north or south or the global lab these kinds of problems are complex because the knowledge is still evolving about certain causes or a certain consequences um science is still evolving and so without very very clear knowledge of foreknowledge um it is difficult to fully predict the outcomes and then fully uh prepare for them um fourth reason that these are complex these environmental problems are Global and complex there are multiple sectors involved so you know we can think of agriculture and fishing and Industry and Mining I mean um many many sectors are involved with um different um preferences and so then figuring out the best solution or Solutions uh it begins to involve politics and trade-offs so it just makes it harder to develop and create cooperation and coordination um and there are just simply there are many kind of levels of uh actors and governance levels of aggregation you know if you can start with the individual but it's not just a bunch of individuals who are coordinating it's Industries it's cities it's nation states it's you know regions or provinces or States like New York state so there are multiple levels which uh again make the process of coordination more difficult also the distribution of the costs to solve the problems or the benefits that occur from solving problems aren't distributed equally you know um we have this question when we think about who's CO2 emissions should we cut should richer countries that have borne the benefit of development have more obligations to cut missions than poorer countries that still have a long way to go so we you know bringing in questions of philosophy and equality into these uh decisions about how to coordinate make the process just that much more complex um and finally the distribution of the costs of environmental problems are also unequal you know in the U.S we might have more wildfires and sea level rise and this and that another thing but you know that's a heck of a lot better than being toovalu or chiribati these are small island nations that because of predicted sea level rise will entirely disappear and so um uh trying to uh coordinate a response about what is fair when some countries are going to just have certain costs in other countries are going to totally states are going to disappear uh again makes these complex problems um which is why it takes decades and decades and decades to to begin to solve them in your textbook stagger writes um that the environmental problems caused by global global climate change are global with local consequences with global consequences meaning you know these big environmental Global environmental problems they have consequences that are specific to any local place um as well as Global consequences um finally I just want to mention that um many problems that you might initially just think of as local so we can think about like local deforestation you might say oh I you know I would be really sad if Bear Mountain State Reserve uh you know started to be deforested um or oh it's really sad in Maine when the lobster fishery collapsed and it was hard for the people of Maine to make a living because um they weren't catching as many lobsters um but actually many of these local um environmental problems have Global causes and Global consequences um and so the collective management of them require mechanisms for governance at local scale but also regionally and globally um so we can think about you know the Amazon in Brazil being converted into pasture uh you know it's converted for the international soybean traded in the Palm trade um and so it's converted because there is a global economic market for these commodity Goods right and so any solution to stopping the conversion and the cutting down of Amazon uh requires uh Global action such as companies agreeing not to buy soybean oil from producers who are producing it by cutting down a virgin Amazon that's one one part of a solution but another part of solution is very local you know the state in montegrasso or wherever in Brazil where this is happening needs to develop policies and enforce those policies so this is what is meant by needing to have uh contributions and coordination at multiple levels of governance multiple scales same thing with if you think about that fish trade international fish trade is go driven by global demand so resolving um any particular uh uh fishery collapse needs to be um tied into solutions that are Global in nature so I want to finally talk about um global climate change is an example of global coordination that solves complex problems and the really important point is that it takes time to um develop both an understanding of a problem and uh to create the management mechanisms that will allow some sort of governance some sort of network governance to begin to address the problem so this is a really good example of how Global coordination is Inc is kind of incremental it builds upon itself and um um how it doesn't just come out of nowhere so this agreement is actually the third treaty adopted by many many countries under kind of a broad umbrella of climate change regime treaties so to quote one scholar of this the Paris agreement quote builds upon a complex body of Institutions rules and procedures which have evolved over 25 years to make up what is known as the UN climate regime most of the Paris Accords Central Concepts and Provisions have roots in earlier texts so the foundations of this regime comprise the 1992 United Nations framework convention on climate change and a 1997 Kyoto Protocol so different countries different parties developed and elaborate institutional infrastructure to strengthen and Implement these treaties they adopted over 500 decisions about many different issues ranging from developing you know a rigorous reporting mechanism and procedure to building capacity to address climate change in developing countries to promoting gender balance and responses to to climate change quote the process was a continual negotiation where parties meet at least twice a year including at the annual sessions of the conference of parties cop end quote some so you may have heard about cop every year there is one held someplace else that is actually sure for Conference of parties that is the U.N climate regime this is World Community negotiating and trying to find ways to solve for climate change problems so by 2015 this Paris agreement Nations committed for the first time to this common goal of limiting climate change uh to a certain amount by limiting that temperature change to 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius on average and they would do so by limiting greenhouse gas emissions so each country would decide and set a limit that by 2030 they would reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by some amount and they had a a plan to get there and by 2050 they would reduce it by an even greater amount the other idea that came out of this was this idea of climate finance that rich countries would help poor ones with paying for climate change adaption it would also out of this Paris agreement you had monitoring of emission reductions every five years um and you know again the idea that they developed world that benefited so much from industrialization would carry more of the burden of reducing greenhouse gas emissions than poor countries and and would pay more to help poor countries reduce their emissions there are many other examples besides climate change of global coordination in your textbook stagger he's compiled a list in this table of other major Global Environmental treaties um that deal with other kinds of problems overfishing or biodiversity there are many different treaties that exist that begin to create a way to coordinate and solve these complex environmental problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in this last lecture I want to review briefly everything that you have learned to give you a sense of how much new information and new approaches and new techniques and theories you have learned over the semester approaches theories techniques to understanding Global Trends what is happening in the world and how the world is interconnected and hopefully you will use these approaches to understand whatever you come across in the news uh in any other classes and I want to start by just reminding you what the core goals of this course were I also want to quickly talk about and the learning objectives because I feel that you have already achieved these to the hard work you've put in in this class you know you guys have definitely learned some new conceptual tools and Concepts and Frameworks and approaches that allow you to think about contemporary problems in a critical analytical way what did we start with in this class we started with chapter one of the textbook and that was uh stagger and we started with just basic definitions of globality Global imaginary globalization localization and over the course of the semester you guys have shown how much you have integrated these these new definitions and understandings into how you think about problems we also started the class by uh thinking about how to just even approach problems from a social science in historical analysis so you learned about George simmel and his concept of optical plurality and honing in and stepping back and using different perspectives to get many different um disciplinary perspectives looking at the same problem in order to understand the entire context um and all the interconnections right and we you learned about Thomas Kuhn who told us uh look facts don't just exist we the fact is partly determined by what we use to see the fact maybe we're using a microscope or a telescope uh maybe we are applying a certain way of thinking that comes from a particular discipline that we've been trained in and this uh is a lens through which we observe a fact and if we're aware of the lens we're using we're aware of the limitations and the need to switch lenses and use multiple lenses to look at a problem and then uh we jumped into the historical section of the class right we analyzed Europe and the people without history Eric Wolff's book in order to kind of understand how globalization has always existed throughout history there's always been a movement of people and goods and food production technology has always expanded human habitation uh there's always been a movement of culture and religious ideologies and ideas and religions and um Empires and political forms of organization have strongly influenced trade routes and globalization in general right if we think about ages of Empire or the rise of Europe in the 15 16th 17th century 18th century uh we immediately understand that you guys in your exam uh really demonstrated an excellent understanding of this idea proposed by wallerstein about core and periphery what they are and how that shifts over time uh you learned about how Commodities and the flow of Commodities uh can are important components to explaining some of these shifts that we see in history and then in the economic section of the class he learned about times that mugs came up with to help us Define and understand what capitalism is and how it works and how capitalism is the most productive for mode of organization right you learned what use value was he learned what exchange value was you learned what labor value was you learned about the definition of a commodity and how capitalism generates value you know how that works um and how time and money became linked under capitalism in a way that in other modes of production that we talked about uh they were not linked finally in the economic section uh you learned a couple of things you learned about you know what value how to think about value and how the neoclassical economic definition of value is not the same as the definition of value that you get when thinking about Societies or society's value you learned what some of the impacts are for a world capitalist system on work patterns in the Contemporary current world with casa teles reading that you read in class talked about flexible work um you learned about the interior lives and interior life trajectories of individuals working in global I.T systems and finally in the economic section we ended with a lecture and readings about neoliberalism and then we moved on to the political dimensions of globalization in this class and we started with this basic question of what is a state and what is nationalism and how does nationalism give rise to a nation-state you guys learned about Civic nationalism and ethnic nationalism you learned about the six characteristics of nation states how nation states um create a common sense of community among citizens an imagined Community among people who may never meet each other but still think of themselves as part of the same nation-state um we also talked about some of the factors that contributed and historical factors that contributed to the rise of nation states out of other kinds of political organization that existed in particular we talked about how the printing press and the development from that of newspapers that individuals could read in a Common Language and have this experience of experiencing the same thing as other people reading that newspaper article or that news article um it then helped people to develop a shared sense of community and uh and imagine Community we talked about what does that mean talked about what sovereignty is right supreme authority over a territory um and we talked about some examples of uh how uh nation states in Europe and the rest of the world developed and then we moved on to some of the challenges two the idea of nation state sovereignty that arise from globalization The Challenge from immigration and citizenship The Challenge from Global governance and intergovernmental organizations like the UN a challenge from Global governance networks and from international non-governmental organizations The Challenge from world society and World culture and we talked about how governance network uh this alternative model of order and that we can no longer just think about an international system with nations with Sovereign Nation States and that is a model that works to explain what's happening in the world rather we need to think of governance networks and all the participants in governance Networks um and then finally we ended by applying all these theories and approaches that we had learned to looking at case studies and looking at topics we looked at the case study of conflict diamonds in the Kimberly process we looked at the topic of migration and immigration we looked at the topic of Global Environmental Collective action problems like global climate change specifically I want to end our semester and our class by inviting you to continue the journey that you all began uh by considering minoring in international studies or majoring in international studies and I want to remind you that there are many different courses in many different departments which can contribute to you getting a major or a minor in international studies you know anthropology philosophy political science uh history economic sociology psychology woman and gender studies black studies of course International Studies you can take classes in all these departments and it will count toward your major and minor if this is something that you are considering doing if you have questions that want to invite you to uh send me an email after the semester is over and we can set up a zoom appointment I would be happy to advise you or even to pass you along to our program director if you would like to learn more about the International Studies minor or major
