Colonialism - taking over other countries through physcical dominance

Mercantilism - economic system/ideology. Value contained in the world is fixed, and if you don't capture it then the competitor will. Create captive markets and protect them. Produce high value manufactured goods that you force your colonies to purchase. You get raw materials and gold and silver. Powerful places controlling colonies as opposed to powerful places controlling territories.

Mercantilism as bridge to Capitalism - ^^^

Mode of Production (definition) - The political economic social way production is organized by humans

Kin-Ordered Mode of Production - Production and consumption organized through kinship (real or fictitious). Kinship may or may not restrict access to resources needed to produce goods.

Alliance Mode of Production - Exchange based on political agreements between groups in order to create obligations.

Tribute Mode of Production - The laborer has access to the means of production with the obligation of tribute to a lord or a ruling elite. "Labor is...mobilized and committed to the transformation of nature primarily through the exercise of power and domination"

Capitalism Exchange System - 

Labor Power - 

Free Human Labor Power (definition) - capitalism required a supply of labor power offered by people who have no other means of using their labor to ensure their livelihoods, to be able to survive.

Stock of Wealth - capitalism requires a surplus of wealth to start and function


## [[Lecture 7]]

Means of Production (different from Mode of Production) -
+ Historically specific: did not exist in 1400 and spread with industrialization
+ Private ownership of the means of productions (capitalists). i.e. machines and tools
+ Distribution of goods controlled by a market
+ People without means of production must become laborers
+ a new class of capitalists develops
+ All or most of the inputs and outputs of production are supplied through the market
+ the laborer is separated from the means of production, access is mediated by elite owners
+ came into being when monetary wealth has enabled to buy labor power
+ for labor power to be offered for sale, the tie between producers and the means of production had to be severed for good (enclosure movement in 18th Century. Britain took away access of peasants to common lands)

Capital - 

Marx - First person to develop idea that capitalism is about the relationship between individuals, stored wealth, and the production. Critiqued capitalism - says it takes away the ownership over the product produced by one's labor and by doing this it takes away freedom from the individual. 

Adam Smith - 

Division of Labor - most important feature of capitalism. It is the engine of productivity in Capitalism, but it alienates us from ourselves just in the same way that we're alienated from the final products we have no ownership over.

Use Value - Value of a product. Its emphasis is on the utility of a product to the living person consuming it. Associates the product's value with the idea that we own what we make. 

Exchange Value - "The proportion in which values in use of one sort or exchange for those of another sort" ~ Karl Marx. The exchange value of a product is not the intrinsic to the product or the qualities, rather it is relative and is dependent on time in space, dependent on who will buy it for how much, which depends on where and when it's sold. 

Labor Value - All commodities are the products of labor, therefore all products contain labor value. Labor is the only intrinsic source of value according to Marx. The true value of a product is measured by the duration of time it takes to produce because it is the measure of the labor involved in producing the product according to Marx. All different types of labor and qualities of labor become reduced to a single uniform measurement.

Commodity (definition) - Something produced for exchange. 

Socially-Determined Labor Time - Flattening of distinct qualities and types of labor to a uniform measure. "The value of labor time in a good is not the number of hours of work that went into making the good, rather it is the proportion of total amount of labor in the entire economy that went into making the good" ~ Marx.

Subsistence Wages - 
+ Wages are always driven toward subsistence under Capitalism
+ Empirically accurate theoretical insight of Marx
+ There are always unemployed in a competitive economy, and because workers have no alternative options, they will accept subsistence wages

How Capitalism Generates Value - 

Surplus Value (definition) - relative to the total value produced by the worker

Rate of Exploitation (definition) - surplus produced by each worker

Why Capitalists Fear Other Capitalists - the less exploitative capitalist can't sell their product without going broke. They do not fear their workers. Capitalists compete against each other, so if one capitalist is able to have more money in their pocket in the end of the day, it means you can lower your price, thus consumers buy your product over the less exploitative capitalist and thus the less exploitative will be put out of business.

Graberâ€™s definition of Value - defines the world in terms of what is meaningful, desirable, and worthwhile.
