Mercantilism - economic system/ideology. Value contained in the world is fixed, and if you don't capture it then the competitor will. Create captive markets and protect them. Produce high value manufactured goods that you force your colonies to purchase. You get raw materials and gold and silver. Powerful places controlling colonies as opposed to powerful places controlling territories.

Means of Production (different from Mode of Production) -
+ Historically specific: did not exist in 1400 and spread with industrialization
+ Private ownership of the means of productions (capitalists). i.e. machines and tools
+ Distribution of goods controlled by a market
+ People without means of production must become laborers
+ a new class of capitalists develops
+ All or most of the inputs and outputs of production are supplied through the market
+ the laborer is separated from the means of production, access is mediated by elite owners
+ came into being when monetary wealth has enabled to buy labor power
+ for labor power to be offered for sale, the tie between producers and the means of production had to be severed for good (enclosure movement in 18th Century. Britain took away access of peasants to common lands)

Capital - 

Marx - First person to develop idea that capitalism is about the relationship between individuals, stored wealth, and the production. Critiqued capitalism - says it takes away the ownership over the product produced by one's labor and by doing this it takes away freedom from the individual. 

Adam Smith - 

Division of Labor - most important feature of capitalism. It is the engine of productivity in Capitalism, but it alienates us from ourselves just in the same way that we're alienated from the final products we have no ownership over.

Use Value - Value of a product. Its emphasis is on the utility of a product to the living person consuming it. Associates the product's value with the idea that we own what we make. 

Exchange Value - "The proportion in which values in use of one sort or exchange for those of another sort" ~ Karl Marx. The exchange value of a product is not the intrinsic to the product or the qualities, rather it is relative and is dependent on time in space, dependent on who will buy it for how much, which depends on where and when it's sold. 

Labor Value - All commodities are the products of labor, therefore all products contain labor value. Labor is the only intrinsic source of value according to Marx
