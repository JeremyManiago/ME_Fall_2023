<u>Colonialism</u> - taking over other countries through physcical dominance

<u>Mercantilism</u> - economic system/ideology. Value contained in the world is fixed, and if you don't capture it then the competitor will. Create captive markets and protect them. Produce high value manufactured goods that you force your colonies to purchase. You get raw materials and gold and silver. Powerful places controlling colonies as opposed to powerful places controlling territories.

Mercantilism as bridge to Capitalism - ^^^

<u>Mode of Production (definition)</u> - The political economic social way production is organized by humans

<u>Kin-Ordered Mode of Production</u> - Production and consumption organized through kinship (real or fictitious). Kinship may or may not restrict access to resources needed to produce goods.

<u>Alliance Mode of Production</u> - Exchange based on political agreements between groups in order to create obligations.

<u>Tribute Mode of Production</u> - The laborer has access to the means of production with the obligation of tribute to a lord or a ruling elite. "Labor is...mobilized and committed to the transformation of nature primarily through the exercise of power and domination"

<u>Capitalism Exchange System</u> - Capitalism is often thought of as an economic system in which private actors own and control property in accord with their interests, and demand and supply freely set prices in markets in a way that can serve the best interests of society. The essential feature of capitalism is the motive to make a profit

<u>Labor Power</u> - the capacity to do work

<u>Free Human Labor Power (definition)</u> - capitalism required a supply of labor power offered by people who have no other means of using their labor to ensure their livelihoods, to be able to survive.

<u>Stock of Wealth</u> - capitalism requires a surplus of wealth to start and function


## [[Lecture 7]]

<u>Means of Production (different from Mode of Production)</u> -
+ Historically specific: did not exist in 1400 and spread with industrialization
+ Private ownership of the means of productions (capitalists). i.e. machines and tools
+ Distribution of goods controlled by a market
+ People without means of production must become laborers
+ a new class of capitalists develops
+ All or most of the inputs and outputs of production are supplied through the market
+ the laborer is separated from the means of production, access is mediated by elite owners
+ came into being when monetary wealth has enabled to buy labor power
+ for labor power to be offered for sale, the tie between producers and the means of production had to be severed for good (enclosure movement in 18th Century. Britain took away access of peasants to common lands)

<u>Capital</u> - wealth in the form of money or other assets owned by a person or organization or available or contributed for a particular purpose such as starting a company or investing

<u>Marx</u> - First person to develop idea that capitalism is about the relationship between individuals, stored wealth, and the production. Critiqued capitalism - says it takes away the ownership over the product produced by one's labor and by doing this it takes away freedom from the individual. 

<u>Adam Smith</u> -

<u>Division of Labor</u> - most important feature of capitalism. It is the engine of productivity in Capitalism, but it alienates us from ourselves just in the same way that we're alienated from the final products we have no ownership over.

<u>Use Value</u> - Value of a product. Its emphasis is on the utility of a product to the living person consuming it. Associates the product's value with the idea that we own what we make. 

<u>Exchange Value</u> - "The proportion in which values in use of one sort or exchange for those of another sort" ~ Karl Marx. The exchange value of a product is not the intrinsic to the product or the qualities, rather it is relative and is dependent on time in space, dependent on who will buy it for how much, which depends on where and when it's sold. 

<u>Labor Value</u> - All commodities are the products of labor, therefore all products contain labor value. Labor is the only intrinsic source of value according to Marx. The true value of a product is measured by the duration of time it takes to produce because it is the measure of the labor involved in producing the product according to Marx. All different types of labor and qualities of labor become reduced to a single uniform measurement.
+ Labor value from living human labor
+ Past labor value embedded in tools, machines, technologies of production
+ Competition motivates technological advances and drives productivity gains
+ Competition pressure capitalists to increase rates of exploitation

<u>Commodity (definition)</u> - Something produced for exchange. A commodity is **a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type**. Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services

<u>Socially-Determined Labor Time</u> - Flattening of distinct qualities and types of labor to a uniform measure. "The value of labor time in a good is not the number of hours of work that went into making the good, rather it is the proportion of total amount of labor in the entire economy that went into making the good" ~ Marx.

## [[Lecture 8]]

<u>Subsistence Wages</u> - 
+ Wages are always driven toward subsistence under Capitalism
+ Empirically accurate theoretical insight of Marx
+ There are always unemployed in a competitive economy, and because workers have no alternative options, they will accept subsistence wages

<u>How Capitalism Generates Value</u> - 
+ Not exploiting workers or paying subsistence - those have a natural floor
+ Finding a way to use the limited labor time more productivity
+ Innovation, technology (e.g. spinning jenny)

<u>Surplus Value (definition)</u> - relative to the total value produced by the worker. Surplus produced over and above what is required to survive - profit

<u>Rate of Exploitation (definition)</u> - surplus produced by each worker. The rate of exploitation is **the ratio of the total amount of unpaid labor done (surplus-value) to the total amount of wages paid (the value of labour power)**. The rate of exploitation is often also called the rate of surplus-value

<u>Why Capitalists Fear Other Capitalists</u> - the less exploitative capitalist can't sell their product without going broke. They do not fear their workers. Capitalists compete against each other, so if one capitalist is able to have more money in their pocket in the end of the day, it means you can lower your price, thus consumers buy your product over the less exploitative capitalist and thus the less exploitative will be put out of business.

<u>Graber’s definition of Value</u> - defines the world in terms of what is meaningful, desirable, and worthwhile.
Graeber's Summary of Labor under Capitalism -
+ Capitalism allows labor to become an abstraction
+ Living human labor becomes a commodity
+ Employers purchase an abstract concept of the capacity to work
+ Money as a token, represents abstract labor
+ Graeber defines value as " the way that our actions take on meaning or importance by becoming incorporated into something larger than ourselves.
+ The process of realizing values in society involves public recognition of those values by other members of the society. Thus society changes due to capitalist modes of production.


## [[Lecture 9]]

<u>Body Shopping</u> - body shop accumulate resources by sending labor overseas. Body-shopping in the Indian IT sector takes informal IT labor and connects it to international buyers of IT skills.

<u>Outsourcing</u> - obtain (goods or a service) from an outside or foreign supplier, especially in place of an internal source

<u>Flexible work</u> -
+ Part-time and flex time work results from the communication revolution which allows for the severing of the connection between work and location
+ Technologies allowed for decentralization and coordination simultaneously
+ Different kinds of workers benefit more than others from connections created by IT
+ "flex time" is a form of driving wages to subsistence levels?
+ EU vs US: Unemployment greater in EU, worker protections lost in US

<u>Impact of Politics on Working Conditions in US vs. Europe (Casatelles reading)</u> - 

<u>Global Work Culture (Radhakrishnan reading)</u> - 
+ Radhakrishnan investigates how the practices and work patterns created by Capitalism in an Indian IT industry conflict with traditional patterns, norms, and societal expectations
+ For Shuba, global IT work provided an opportunity for independence from her conservative, rich, and high status family
+ For Rani, it offered an avenue for self-actualization, and tied her even closer to her family, despite it causing her to move across the world to Silicon Valley
+ For Bharathi, global IT forced her to adopt global cosmopolitan culture, that is a self-isolated, homogenous in thoughts, tastes, and aspirations
+ Globalization results in 'being Indian' being redefined in relation to the global. The professional workplace behavior is affecting the interior sense of self and culture


## [[Lecture 10]]

<u>Neoliberalism</u> - political economic arrangement that allows capitalists to continuously expand market. 

<u>Liberalism (definition)</u> - political idea that the individuals and individual freedom is of the greatest importance. Government should protect individual freedom, which can mean upholding individual rights and also protecting individuals form the encroachment on their rights by other entities.

<u>Crisis of Capital Accumulation</u> - **occurs when the rate of profit is greater than the rate of new profitable investment outlets in the economy**, arising from increasing productivity from a rising organic composition of capital (higher capital input to labor input ratio)

<u>2008 Financial and Housing Crisis in the US</u> - **The growth of predatory mortgage lending, unregulated markets, a massive amount of consumer debt, the creation of "toxic" assets, the collapse of home prices, and more** contributed to the financial crisis of 2008

<u>Bretton Woods</u> - conference for Institutions of Global Neoliberalism. The Bretton Woods system of monetary management established the rules for commercial relations among the United States, Canada, Western European countries, and Australia among 44 other countries after the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement

<u>World Bank</u> - Provided loans initially to Europeans countries right after war to assist with development. During Cold War it provided loans to countries as a political tool to combat Communism. Since 1970's it has provided loans to all sorts of countries to support neoliberal interest and deregulation of economies.

<u>International Monetary Fund (IMF)</u> - Creates stable National currency exchange rates that contribute to predictability needed for global businesses to flourish. They make loans to countries facing currency crises and focus on nations budget deficits, monetary policies, inflations, and trade deficits.

<u>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)</u> - Created to develop and enforce multilateral trade rules (trade between two or more nations)

<u>The World Trade Organization (WTO)</u> - Successor to GATT

<u>Deregulation</u> - the removal of regulations or restrictions, especially in a particular industry

<u>Privatization</u> - **occurs when a government-owned business, operation, or property becomes owned by a private, non-government party**. Privatization also may describe a transition that takes a company from being publicly traded to becoming privately held. This is referred to as corporate privatization

<u>Financialization</u> - "The increasing role of financial motives, financial markets, financial actors, and financial institutions in the operation of domestic and international economies." Financialization is **a process whereby financial markets, financial institutions, and financial elites gain greater influence over economic policy and economic outcomes**. Financialization transforms the functioning of economic systems at both the macro and micro levels

<u>Benefits of Neoliberalism</u> - 
+ Productivity of National Economies
+ Raised people out of poverty
+ Technology transfer to other nations
+ Privatization of uncompetitive state-owned enterprises and efficient provision of services

<u>Negative Outcomes of Neoliberalism</u> - 
+ "However, there are aspects of the neoliberal agenda that have not delivered as expected/ Our assessment of the agenda is confined to the effects of two policies: removing restrictions on the movement of capital across a country's borders (so-called capital account liberalization); and fiscal consolidation, sometimes called "austerity", which is shorthand for policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels. An assessment of these specific policies (rather than the broad neoliberal agenda) reaches three disquieting conclusions:
	+ The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries
	+ The costs in terms of increases inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda
	+ Increase inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects."
(Ostry et al., 2016)

<u>Wealth Distribution</u> - Capitalism may be seen to range between Classical Capitalism, where **the rich have only capital income**, and the rest have only labor income, and Liberal Capitalism, where many people receive both capital and labor incomes

<u>Structural Adjustment</u>  - IMF and World Bank make two countries where they lend money with the requirement that countries reduce amount of money that they spend on social programs. A structural adjustment is **a set of economic reforms that a country must adhere to in order to secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund and/or the World Bank**. Structural adjustments are often a set of economic policies, including reducing government spending, opening to free trade, and so on

<u>Concrete Examples of Neoliberal Policies</u> -
+ Policies creating ideal markets and competitions
	+ privatize public industries (state owned are sold to private individuals)
	+ deregulate economy (fewer protections)
	+ tax cuts (because taxes hinder supply and demand signaling and therefore balance)
	+ monetary policy to keep inflation in check
	+ control unions and organized labor (ensure the labor market determines wages & benefits)
	+ expand to international markets
	+ remove global financial controls (money can move anywhere)
+ Policies reducing the demand for tax revenue
	+ reduce public expenditures (universities, social spending)
	+ downsize government
