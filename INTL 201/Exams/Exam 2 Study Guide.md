Colonialism - taking over other countries through physcical dominance

Mercantilism - economic system/ideology. Value contained in the world is fixed, and if you don't capture it then the competitor will. Create captive markets and protect them. Produce high value manufactured goods that you force your colonies to purchase. You get raw materials and gold and silver. Powerful places controlling colonies as opposed to powerful places controlling territories.
