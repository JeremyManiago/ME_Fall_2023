<u>Silk Route</u>


<u>Portuguese carrack ship</u>
The Carnaval. Carracks were used by the Portuguese for trade in the 14th through 16th centuries, first in the Mediterranean and Baltic, and by the 15th century, for trade between Europe and Asia, Africa, and the Americas.

### <u>Core</u>
- areas that produce manufactured goods that are high value. Exported to the Periphery

### <u>Periphery</u>
- areas that produce & export raw materials and commodities (horses from Central Asia, gold from Sub-Saharan Africa, silver from Germany, slaves from Russia & Sub-Saharan Africa). Exported to the Core

### <u>Core and Periphery change over the course of history</u>
- Europe in the 1400s was a Periphery
- Southern Spain in the 11th century (1000s) 
	- not until one of cities, Granada, fell to Spanish Kingdom of Castillo did they shift from Periphery to Core
		- Castillos kick out Nors (North Africans) and exiled Jews
	- Thus Spain began to rise to power and shift into a Core
- Trade routes impact how Core and Periphery shift
	- Silk Route was important (major way) in how goods moved from West to East and East to West
		- 14th century (1300s), Ming Dynasty deployed military to borders, build Great Wall of China, thus trade gets slower and more costly. Started to close borders because of of threats 
		- Silk Route started to get less important because silk was being produced in other areas
			- Silk worms were smuggled out to France, which started to produce silk
	- Big ships that can go around cape of Good Hope in Africa was an alternative to going by land
		- More ships being used as opposed to land
		- Powers that got rich and important due to the route began to lose money and lose their control/power

- In 1400s, which cities that were largest would become dominate powers 200 years later (in 1600s)???
	- Cairo, Egypt
	- Hangzhou, China
		- Half a million people in both Cairo and Hangzhou
	- Unfortunately, this was not the case based on history
- 

### <u>Great Bullion Famine</u>
- Not enough currency (gold, silver, money)
- Europe was not rich in precious metals it needed by the end of the Middle Ages
- Ancient Romans founded gold mines in the Alps, but started to dry up after a thousand years
	- Mostly silver mines in Bohemia, Germany and Czech Republic
	- Began to become less productive
	- Negotiation was not an option as well as finding different suppliers because they were trading with Monopolies (Venice, Ottomans)
- mid 1350s till 1450s saw decline of gold/silver mine outputs
	- exhaustion of mines
	- lack of manpower
		- Black Death killed of many Europeans
		- Not enough workers to put in mines
- Scarcity drove Europeans to search for more gold and cheaper trade
- Impact was felt all the way to China
	- Not a lot of silver and gold creates deflation
		- Deflation causes value of a "dollar" to increase, and does not bring incentive to risk waiting for it to increase in value. Economy grinds to a halt since investing is not worth
	- Value of silver and gold increase, causing economic hardship in Europe
	- Impacted production of goods in Ming Dynasty 
- Europeans are motivated to go to Africa and the New World (Americas)
- Access to gold they could have dissapeared during the mid 1400s
	- Ottomans took Constantinople (Istanbul) from Western World and kicked out Christians in 1453, thus they took control all the areas around the Black Sea
	- Before 1453, the Venetians could trade and controlled the trade around Black Sea that produced Gold
		- Once they lost power and control, their trade was strangled and Venice began to decline
		- Made new ships
		- Price of gold shot up in Europe due to lack of gold coming from Venetians
- Portuguese went to Africa
- Spain went to China (Christopher Columbus)


### <u>Sugar Triangle Trade</u>
- North Coast of Africa 
- Between 4 continents
- Shifted Cores away from China and India into Europe
- Beginning of new economic production system called Mercantilism
- "First drug trade"

<u>Mercantilism</u>
- West Africans were purchased using high value manufactured goods 
- Taken to New World to produce sugar or mine gold or silver
- Enslavement of Indigenous peoples to mine gold and silver
- Goods shipped to Core (Europe) in return for manufactured goods
- "An economic policy designed to maximize emports and minimize imports" - Wikipedia
- Total goods are fixed
	- Want to take as much of that before someone else can take it
	- Maximize what you export
	- Minimize what you import (raw materials) from other people that aren't your colonies
- French Bombardment of Algiers in 1683 during the French Algerian War
	- Algerians don't want to be able to trade only France
	- Send warships to Algeria and bombard coast as threat that they can only trade to France
- Trade is a zero sum game
	- Trade redistributes wealth. If one power gains, the other power naturally loses

<u>Colonialism</u>
- Maximize exports (Mercantilism)
- More colonies means more trade routes and more goods

<u>Navy</u>
- Use currency you acquired from colonies to build Navy and Army
